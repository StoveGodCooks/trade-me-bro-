1. New York State Investigative Report
New York's Medicaid program is one of the most expansive and complex in the United States, serving over 7 million enrollees. The state’s move toward a comprehensive Managed Care (MMC) model was intended to control costs through a global spending cap, but this transition has created a decentralized oversight environment where private entities are tasked with self-policing, often with mixed results.
System Overview
The New York Medicaid system is governed by a triad of agencies: the Department of Health (DOH), the Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG), and the Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU). OMIG operates under Section 32 of the Public Health Law, tasked with coordinating activities to prevent, detect, and investigate medical assistance program fraud. The system’s financial scale is managed through a "Global Cap" index, which increased from $\$28.3$ billion in FY 2024 to $\$31.6$ billion in FY 2025. This cap is tied to a five-year rolling average of the Medicaid annual growth rate, a mechanism that attempts to stabilize expenditures amidst fluctuating enrollment.
The administrative heart of the program is the Medicaid Managed Care model, where the state pays fixed monthly premiums to MCOs to manage the care of enrollees. In the second quarter of SFY 2024-2025, managed care spending reached approximately $\$11.7$ billion, with Mainstream Managed Care and Managed Long-Term Care (MLTC) each accounting for roughly half of that total. The shift toward MLTC is particularly notable, as it represents the costliest population within the Medicaid program, with enrollment projected to increase by over 36,000 individuals as of March 2025.
Fraud Case Analysis
New York serves as a primary target for sophisticated, high-value fraud schemes. The most significant recent investigation, "Operation Gold Rush," uncovered a Russian-based transnational criminal organization that orchestrated a scheme involving over $\$10.6$ billion in fraudulent Medicare and Medicaid claims. This organization utilized a complex cyberinfrastructure, including Virtual Private Servers (VPS), to mask IP addresses and conceal the true physical locations of the conspirators. The scheme primarily targeted Durable Medical Equipment (DME) billing, using nominee owners—many of whom were not lawfully present in the United States—to open financial accounts and funnel stolen funds through shell companies and banks in China, Singapore, and Pakistan. To further obfuscate the money trail, the organization leveraged cryptocurrency, a growing trend in high-level healthcare fraud.
On a more localized level, the transportation sector continues to be plagued by "phantom billing" and kickback schemes. In Orange County, the principals of Unique Class Limo, Inc., Rohail Raja and Sharma Alam, were indicted for stealing over $\$3.5$ million from the New York State Department of Health. The investigation revealed that the defendants submitted false claims for transporting Medicaid recipients to medical providers on dates when the provider records showed no visits occurred. Furthermore, they engaged in a "trip splitting" scheme, billing for separate trips for individuals who were actually transported together in a single vehicle. The defendants allegedly bribed patients and drivers to facilitate these fraudulent submissions, highlighting a critical vulnerability in the state's verification of non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) services.
Nursing home fraud also remains a top priority for the New York MFCU. In late 2024 and 2025, Attorney General Letitia James secured significant settlements against facilities like Centers for Care ( $\$45$ million) and the Van Duyn nursing home ( $\$12$ million). These cases typically involve "related-party transactions," where facility owners divert Medicaid funds meant for resident care into separate real estate or staffing companies they also own, leading to chronic understaffing and neglect.
MCO-Related Fraud and Oversight Failures
The oversight of Managed Care Organizations in New York has faced scrutiny for its reliance on MCO self-reporting. Under the terms of the Medicaid Managed Care Model Contract, MCOs are required to submit monthly and quarterly "Provider Investigative Reports" to OMIG and DOH, detailing all investigative, educational, or re-educational activities and any overpayments recovered. However, a CMS focused program integrity review for FY 2020-2022 identified a major gap in interagency coordination: the lack of a written agreement or established procedure for the MFCU to receive fraud referrals directly from MCOs.
Furthermore, CMS encouraged New York to establish minimum staffing ratios for MCO Special Investigation Units (SIUs), noting that current resources may not be commensurate with the size of the Medicaid managed care programs being managed. The reliance on "proprietary algorithms" by MCOs for utilization management and fraud detection also creates a "black box" where neither the state nor the public can fully verify the accuracy of care denials or the effectiveness of fraud prevention.
State Blind Spots and Loopholes
A primary blind spot in the New York system is the regulation of Social Adult Day Care (SADC) centers. These facilities, which provide social and nutritional support to elderly enrollees, have been identified as sites of widespread exploitation. Investigations by the New York Post and law enforcement revealed that many SADCs offer little to no medical or social support, instead operating as "scams" where able-bodied individuals are recruited with cash bribes to pretend to receive services. Because SADCs bill Medicaid through MLTC plans, and because the state's oversight of these plans is often deferred to the MCOs themselves, the program has become a target for large-scale siphoning of funds.
Another loophole exists in the "Self-Disclosure" process. While providers and MCOs are legally required to report and return overpayments within 60 days of identification, OMIG has noted ongoing challenges in the consistency of these reports. Specifically, the identification of capitation payments made for incarcerated or deceased enrollees remains a persistent issue, with OMIG planning expanded audits to recover millions in improperly paid premiums.
Money Flow and Entity Analysis
The flow of capital from Medicaid contracts back into the political system suggests a high degree of "regulatory capture." Centene Corporation, a dominant player in the New York MMC market, has utilized a strategy of making campaign contributions through its vast network of over 300 subsidiaries. By distributing donations across seemingly unrelated corporate entities, Centene can effectively bypass individual and corporate contribution limits, exerting significant influence over the officials who oversee its multi-billion-dollar contracts.
In 2024, the healthcare industry was the leading spender on lobbying in New York. The 1199SEIU Healthcare Education Project spent $\$11.5$ million, while the Alliance to Protect Home Care, Inc. spent $\$ 10.6$ million. These organizations lobby on critical budget appropriations and health policies that directly affect the flow of Medicaid dollars, particularly in the high-growth home care and long-term care sectors.
New York Medicaid Global Cap Component	SFY 2024 Projected ($ millions)	SFY 2025 Projected ($ millions)
Global Cap Index	$\$23,265$	$\$24,832$
DOH Spending Outside Cap	$\$4,986$	$\$6,802$
Local Growth Takeover	$\$1,830$	$\$2,013$
Home Care Minimum Wage	$\$916$	$\$ 1,480$
Total Global Cap Target	$\$28,251$	$\$31,634$
State Summary
New York's Medicaid program is a study in the challenges of massive scale. While the state has established one of the most robust oversight frameworks in the nation, the sheer volume of transactions and the complexity of the managed care model provide ample cover for both institutionalized corporate overbilling and high-level criminal schemes. The future of New York's program integrity depends on closing the coordination gap between MCOs and the MFCU, increasing transparency in MLTC and SADC spending, and addressing the influence of campaign capital on regulatory enforcement.

STATE OF NEW YORK
A. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
1. System Structure
New York operates a massive Managed Care (MMC) system serving over 7 million enrollees, governed by a "Global Cap" on spending ($31.6 billion in FY 2025). The system is a "triad" of the Department of Health (DOH), Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG), and the Attorney General’s MFCU.
2. Key MCOs
    • Centene Corporation (Dominant player via Fidelis Care and other subsidiaries).
    • Regional Plans: (e.g., Healthfirst, EmblemHealth - implied by market context).
    • Managed Long-Term Care (MLTC) Plans: Specialized plans for the elderly/disabled, accounting for half of managed care spending.
3. Oversight & Enforcement
    • OMIG: Operates under Public Health Law Section 32; conducts audits and "self-disclosure" reviews.
    • MFCU: A highly aggressive prosecutorial unit, recently securing multi-million dollar settlements.
4. Structural Vulnerabilities
The Managed Long-Term Care (MLTC) sector is the "costliest population" and highly vulnerable to Social Adult Day Care (SADC) fraud. Additionally, MCOs rely on "proprietary algorithms" for fraud detection, creating a "black box" the state cannot verify.

B. FRAUD CASE ANALYSIS
1. Major Criminal & Civil Cases (2024-2025)
    • Operation Gold Rush (Russian TCO):
      A transnational criminal organization (TCO) orchestrated a $10.6 billion scheme (part of a $14.6B national takedown).
        ? Mechanism: Targeted Durable Medical Equipment (DME) billing.
        ? Concealment: Used "Virtual Private Servers" to mask IP addresses and "nominee owners" (often ineligible aliens) to open accounts.
        ? Laundering: Funneled funds to China, Singapore, and Pakistan via cryptocurrency.
    • SADC Kickback Scheme (United States v. Wasef & Antao):
      Two recruiters pleaded guilty to a $68 million fraud scheme involving "Happy Family Social Adult Day Care" and "Family Social Adult Day Care" in Brooklyn.
        ? Scheme: Paid cash kickbacks to Medicaid recipients to attend adult day care (or just sign in).
        ? Billing: Billed MLTC plans for services that were either unnecessary or never provided.
    • Phantom Transportation (State v. Unique Class Limo):
      Owners Rohail Raja and Sharma Alam were indicted for stealing $3.5 million.
        ? Scheme: "Phantom billing" (billing for trips not taken) and "trip splitting" (billing group rides as individual solo rides).
        ? Corruption: Bribed patients and drivers to falsify logs.
    • Nursing Home Self-Dealing (Centers for Care):
      AG Letitia James secured a $45 million settlement against Centers for Care.
        ? Scheme: Owners diverted Medicaid funds to related-party companies (real estate/staffing entities they also owned) rather than patient care, leading to neglect.
2. Pattern Analysis
    • "Body Brokering": In both the SADC and Transportation cases, patients are bribed (kickbacks) to participate in the fraud. The patient becomes a co-conspirator.
    • Shell Layers: The Russian TCO and Nursing Home owners both used complex corporate structures (shell companies or related-party vendors) to siphon money away from direct care.

C. MCO-RELATED FRAUD & OVERSIGHT FAILURES
1. The Referral Gap
A CMS review found New York has no written agreement for MCOs to refer fraud cases directly to the MFCU.
    • Consequence: MCOs may handle fraud "internally" (e.g., just denying the claim) without alerting law enforcement, allowing the fraudster to move to a different MCO.
2. MLTC Delegation
The state delegates oversight of Social Adult Day Care (SADC) centers to the MLTC plans. However, MLTC plans are incentivized to keep enrollment high (to collect capitation). This conflict of interest allowed the $68 million Happy Family scheme to flourish for years.
3. Understaffed SIUs
CMS noted that MCO "Special Investigation Units" (SIUs) are under-resourced relative to the billions of dollars they manage.

D. STATE BLIND SPOTS & LOOPHOLES
1. Social Adult Day Care (SADC)
SADCs are a massive blind spot. They are non-medical facilities billed through medical plans.
    • Loophole: "Social" services are hard to medically verify. Fraudsters recruit able-bodied seniors with cash to hang out at a center, billing Medicaid for "supervision".
2. Related-Party Transactions
Nursing homes and MLTCs legally funnel money to themselves via "rent" or "consulting" fees paid to companies they own.
    • Impact: This siphons public funds into private profit while the facility claims poverty or understaffing.
3. "Proprietary" Algorithms
MCOs use secret algorithms to approve/deny care. The state cannot audit these effectively, creating a "black box" where profit motives can be disguised as "utilization management".

E. MONEY FLOW & ENTITY ANALYSIS
1. Centene's Donation Web
Centene Corporation uses a network of 300+ subsidiaries to donate to New York politicians.
    • Effect: This bypasses contribution limits and obscures the total influence exerted by the company on state officials.
2. Lobbying Juggernauts
The 1199SEIU Healthcare Education Project ($11.5M) and Alliance to Protect Home Care ($10.6M) spend massively to influence the "Global Cap" and home care wages. This lobbying preserves the high-cost structures (like MLTC) that are vulnerable to fraud.

F. STATE-SPECIFIC POLICY ANALYSIS
1. The "Global Cap" Pressure
The Global Cap ($31.6B) attempts to limit spending but creates pressure to cut "rates" rather than "fraud." MCOs may deny legitimate care to stay under cap while missing complex fraud due to understaffed SIUs.
2. Self-Disclosure Weakness
While New York has a "Self-Disclosure" law, OMIG notes inconsistency in reporting, particularly for incarcerated or deceased enrollees.

G. HOT-TOPIC DEEP DIVES
1. DEEP DIVE: The SADC Kickback Machine
    • Context: Social Adult Day Care is intended for seniors with cognitive decline.
    • Case: United States v. Wasef (Happy Family SADC).
    • Mechanism: Recruiters (Wasef/Antao) treated seniors as "assets," paying them kickbacks to attend. The SADC billed Medicaid for "socialization" and "meals."
    • Systemic Flaw: The "medical necessity" for a social club is vague. MCOs (MLTCs) received capitation for these members and had little incentive to kick them out.
2. DEEP DIVE: Operation Gold Rush (Crypto-DME)
    • Sophistication: This was not a "billing error" but a cyber-crime.
    • Tech: Use of VPS and crypto-laundering.
    • Implication: Medicaid fraud has evolved into transnational cyber-theft, yet state auditors are still looking for "missing signatures" on paper logs.

H. CASE MAPPING
1. Case: Unique Class Limo
    • Actors: Rohail Raja, Sharma Alam.
    • Scheme: Phantom Trips + Trip Splitting.
    • Flow: $3.5M $\to$ Unique Class Limo $\to$ Cash Bribes to Patients/Drivers.
    • Concealment: Falsified trip logs; bribes ensured patient silence.
2. Case: Centers for Care (Nursing Home)
    • Mechanism: Related-Party Transactions.
    • Flow: Medicaid $\to$ Nursing Home $\to$ Owner's Real Estate Co. (Rent) $\to$ Owner's Pocket.
    • Victim: Residents (understaffing) + Taxpayers.

K. FINAL STATE SUMMARY: NEW YORK
1. Key Fraud Mechanisms
New York is defined by high-value organized schemes (Russian TCOs, SADC rings) and complex financial engineering (Nursing home self-dealing).
2. Key Actors
    • Transnational: Russian criminal networks.
    • Local: Transportation brokers and SADC owners.
    • Corporate: Nursing home chains using related-party shells.
3. Execution
Fraudsters exploit the opacity of the Managed Long-Term Care (MLTC) system. The "social" nature of benefits (day care, transport) makes verification difficult compared to clinical procedures.
4. Oversight Failures
The MCO-MFCU disconnect is critical. Without a mandatory referral pipeline, MCOs are "firewalled" from law enforcement.
5. Structural Recommendations
    • Enforce Related-Party Transparency: Cap the profit margins on payments to vendor companies owned by nursing home operators.
    • Biometric SADC Check-ins: Require fingerprint/facial scan for SADC attendance to stop kickback-driven "ghost" attendance.
    • SIU Staffing Mandates: Require MCOs to hire SIU staff proportional to their enrollment.
