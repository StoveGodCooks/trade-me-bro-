---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This unified investigative report synthesizes evidence from seven state-level Medicaid fraud investigations, revealing a systemic nationwide failure in managed care oversight that has enabled fraud on an unprecedented scale. The evidence demonstrates this is not a series of isolated state failures, but rather the predictable output of a fundamentally broken system operating as designed.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Scale of Fraud:** Estimated $50+ billion stolen across seven states between 2020-2025
2. **Recovery Rate:** 5-15% nationwide; 85-95% of stolen funds never recovered
3. **Primary Mechanism:** Managed Care Organization (MCO) payment structures create blind spots covering 70-97% of Medicaid spending
4. **Political Protection:** Systematic pattern of campaign donations preceding contract awards and enforcement leniency
5. **International Component:** Billions transferred overseas to countries with limited cooperation (China, Somalia, Kenya, Armenia, India, Pakistan, Dubai)
6. **Organized Crime:** Transnational criminal networks (Armenian, Somali, Russian) have established U.S. healthcare fraud as core operations

| Colorado | $10B+ | $2-4B (estimated) | 20-23% identified | Risk adjustment fraud, RAC failures |
| Florida | $35B+ | $4-8B (estimated) | Unknown | Hospice fraud, pharmaceutical kickbacks |

**Total Estimated 5-Year Fraud:** $50-82 Billion  
**Total Recovered:** $5-8 Billion  
**Missing:** $42-74 Billion

### Systemic Vulnerabilities Identified

### Recovery Failure Analysis

**Domestic Recovery Challenges:**
- Shell company structures obscure beneficial ownership
- Real estate purchases in straw owners' names
- Gold and precious metals (CA: $6M+ in Shaklian case)
- Cryptocurrency laundering (NY: Operation Gold Rush)
- Multi-layered financial vehicles

**International Recovery Near-Impossible:**

| Destination | Amount Documented | Recovery Rate | Cooperation Level |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| China | $1.1M+ (MN) | 0% | Non-cooperative |
| Somalia | $1M+ (MN) | 0% | No framework; terror investigation ongoing |

## 1. METHODOLOGY

### 1.1 Document Analysis Approach

This unified investigative report synthesizes seven comprehensive state-level investigations plus project documentation spanning Minnesota, California, Texas, New York, Illinois, Colorado, and Florida. The analysis employed the following methodology:

**Primary Sources:**
- State investigative reports (7 documents: MN.odt, cali.odt, texas.odt, Newyork.odt, illinois.odt, Colorado.odt, Florida.odt)
- Project development documentation
- Federal court records (PACER system)
- Department of Justice press releases
- CMS Focused Program Integrity Reviews
- State auditor reports
- Congressional testimony and hearings
- Investigative journalism (ProPublica, MinnPost, California Healthline, KFF Health News)
- Campaign finance databases
- Whistleblower lawsuit filings

**Analytical Framework:**
1. **Duplicate Elimination:** All documents were cross-referenced to identify and remove redundant information. Where multiple sources confirmed the same fact, the most authoritative source was cited.

2. **Contradiction Resolution:** When documents presented conflicting information, resolution followed this hierarchy:
   - Federal court records (highest authority)
   - Official government reports (DOJ, CMS, state auditors)
   - Investigative journalism with documented sources
   - Statements from officials (lowest priority without corroboration)

3. **Pattern Identification:** The analysis employed cross-state comparison matrices to identify:
   - Identical fraud mechanisms across states
   - Identical oversight failures
   - Identical political dynamics
   - Repeated actors or entities
   - Systemic vulnerabilities

4. **Inference Labeling:** All analytical inferences are explicitly labeled. Statements of fact are supported by source citations. Estimated figures are clearly marked as estimates with methodology explained.

### 1.2 Duplicate Removal Process

The source documents contained significant overlap, particularly regarding:
- National MCO companies operating in multiple states (Centene, UnitedHealth, Molina)
- Federal oversight agencies (CMS, HHS-OIG)
- Common fraud schemes (hospice, pharmacy, NEMT)
- COVID-19 policy impacts

**Consolidation Rules Applied:**
- Company descriptions: Consolidated into single Section 6 entity profiles
- Federal oversight findings: Merged into Section 3 national overview
- Fraud scheme descriptions: Unique cases retained; duplicate pattern descriptions removed
- Political donation patterns: State-specific retained; general corruption descriptions consolidated

### 1.3 Cross-Verification Standards

**Three-Source Rule:** Major claims (fraud amounts, conviction details, systemic failures) required confirmation from at least three independent sources unless from federal court records or official government reports.

**Conflict Resolution Example:**
- Minnesota fraud estimates varied from $9B (DOJ official) to $28B (U.S. Attorney statement)
- Resolution: $9B documented; $28B estimated (including MCO); both figures retained with clear attribution

**Unsupported Claims Flagged:**
- Several documents contained assertions about political motivations without documentation
- These were either verified through court records/testimony or removed
- Where relevant but unverified, explicitly labeled as allegations

### 1.4 Financial Estimation Methodology

Total fraud estimates for states without official figures employed the following methodology:

**Base Calculation:**
- Annual Medicaid spending × % through MCOs × estimated fraud rate (5-15%) × years examined (5)

**Fraud Rate Justification:**
- Minnesota documented recovery rate <1%; actual fraud likely 10-15%
- Texas recovery rate 5-15% of identified fraud; unidentified fraud substantially higher
- California AG stated "billions annually"; with $125B+ budget, 5-10% fraud rate = $6.25B-12.5B/year
- National healthcare fraud estimates typically 5-10% of total spending

**Conservative Approach:**
- All estimates use lower end of ranges
- Rounded down to avoid inflation
- Clearly labeled as estimates

## 2. NATIONAL OVERVIEW: SYSTEMIC MEDICAID MANAGED CARE VULNERABILITIES

### 2.1 The Managed Care Organization Model

**Structure:**
Since the 1990s, states have increasingly shifted Medicaid beneficiaries from traditional fee-for-service models to Managed Care Organizations (MCOs). Under this structure:

1. **Capitation Payments:** States pay MCOs a fixed monthly amount per enrollee
2. **Risk Transfer:** MCOs assume financial risk for providing all covered services
3. **Network Management:** MCOs contract with providers to deliver care
4. **Claims Processing:** MCOs internally process and pay provider claims
5. **Oversight Responsibility:** MCOs are responsible for detecting and preventing fraud within their networks

**National Penetration:**
- **70-97% of Medicaid beneficiaries** now enrolled in managed care nationally
- **$750+ billion annually** flows through MCO systems
- **16-20 MCOs** control majority of national market
- **Top 5 companies** (Centene, UnitedHealth, Elevance/Anthem, Molina, CVS/Aetna) manage 60%+ of beneficiaries

### 2.2 The Fundamental Conflict of Interest

**The Incentive Problem:**

MCOs face contradictory incentives regarding fraud detection:

**Incentive to Detect Fraud:**
- Fraudulent payments reduce MCO profitability
- State contracts may include fraud detection performance metrics
- Repeated fraud exposure creates reputational risk

**Incentive to Tolerate Fraud:**
- Aggressive fraud detection is expensive (staffing, technology, investigation costs)
- Fraud-inflated historical spending justifies higher future capitation rates
- Disrupting provider networks by removing fraudulent providers may affect member access
- Reporting fraud to state agencies invites increased oversight
- MCO liability for fraud they failed to detect creates legal risk from aggressive investigation

**The Result:**
As documented across all seven states, MCOs systemically under-invest in fraud detection, under-report fraud to authorities, and maintain inadequate Special Investigative Units.

### 2.3 Federal Regulatory Framework and Failures

**Applicable Federal Regulations:**

**42 CFR § 455.21 - Payment Suspension:**
Requires states to suspend Medicaid payments upon "credible allegation of fraud." CMS guidance specifies this applies to MCO payments to providers.

**Documented Violations:**
- **Texas:** State law conflicts with federal requirement; no payment suspensions since 2015
- **Colorado:** MCO contracts required state approval before suspensions (illegal)
- **Florida:** MFCU agreement outdated; no suspension procedures

**42 CFR § 455.21(c)(3)(iv) - MCO Fraud Referrals:**
Requires states to have established procedures for MCOs to refer fraud to the state's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit.

**Documented Violations:**
- **New York:** No written agreement or procedure for MCO-to-MFCU referrals
- **California:** Low referral rates; state does not track credible allegations from MCOs
- **Texas:** No MCO-to-MFCU referral tracking by state

**CMS Enforcement Response:**
Despite documenting these violations in Focused Program Integrity Reviews, CMS:
- Issues "observations" rather than formal findings of non-compliance
- Does not require corrective action plans with deadlines
- Imposes no financial penalties
- Allows violations to persist for years

### 2.4 The Audit Blindspot: How 70-97% of Medicaid Escapes Independent Oversight

**State-by-State Audit Coverage:**

| State | Total Medicaid | % Through MCOs | MCO Annual | Independent Audit Coverage | Blindspot |
|-------|----------------|----------------|------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| Minnesota | $10.0B | 80% | $8.0B | Direct payments only ($1.9B) | $8.0B unaudited |
| Texas | $41.0B | 97% | $39.8B | Unknown; CMS found failures | $35-40B estimated |
| California | $125B+ | 80%+ | $100B+ | Unknown; DHCS oversight inadequate | $100B+ estimated |
| New York | $90B+ | 80%+ | $72B+ | No MCO internal operations audit | $72B+ estimated |
| Illinois | $30B+ | Near-universal | $28B+ | No PBM contract access | $28B+ estimated |
| Colorado | $10B+ | Hybrid (RAEs) | $8B+ | RAE fraud detection minimal | $8B+ estimated |
| Florida | $35B+ | 97% | $34B+ | MCO self-audit only | $34B+ estimated |

**Total National Estimate:** $750B+ flows through MCOs annually with minimal independent fraud oversight.

**The Minnesota Example (Best Documented):**

Governor Walz hired Optum (UnitedHealth subsidiary) to audit Minnesota Medicaid. The audit explicitly excluded MCO claims - covering only 20% of Medicaid spending. The 80% flowing through MCOs ($8B annually) receives zero independent third-party audit.

**Why This Matters:**
- Fraudsters can exploit both channels simultaneously: submit claims to direct channel (monitored) and MCO channel (unmonitored)
- Known fraudsters under FBI investigation continued billing MCOs while being prosecuted for direct-channel fraud
- MCO audit systems flag obvious duplicates but miss sophisticated fraud
- Recovery rates for MCO fraud are 5-15% versus 20-30% for direct-channel fraud

### 2.5 Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Opacity

**The PBM Problem:**

Pharmacy Benefit Managers process prescription drug claims for MCOs. This creates an additional layer of opacity:

**Illinois Example:**
- State Auditor General found over $200M in PBM "spread pricing" overbilling over two years
- Illinois HFS lacked complete copies of contracts between MCOs and their PBM subcontractors
- State could not verify if PBM prices matched pharmacy reimbursements

**National PBM-GPO Structures:**
- Zinc (owned by CVS)
- Ascent (owned by Cigna)
- Emisar (owned by UnitedHealth)

These "Group Purchasing Organizations" function as "fee-masking vehicles" that allow healthcare corporations to hide rebates and fees from plan sponsors.

**California Magellan/Centene Example:**
- DHCS awarded Medi-Cal Rx contract to Magellan
- Centene acquired Magellan, creating massive conflict: Centene operates MCOs and now manages pharmacy benefits for all competitors
- Centene gained access to all competitors' pharmacy data
- System rollout botched: 95,000+ Californians didn't receive medications (February 2022)

### 2.6 Provider Enrollment: The Gateway Vulnerability

**Straw Owner Structures:**

Across all seven states, fraud networks use "straw owners" to conceal beneficial ownership:

**The Mechanism:**
1. Fraudster identifies individual willing to be nominee owner
2. Nominee's name appears on Medicare/Medicaid enrollment applications
3. Nominee's name appears on bank accounts, property leases
4. Actual fraudster controls operations, keeps proceeds
5. When caught, nominee faces prosecution; fraudster has separation

**California Examples:**
- Sophia Shaklian used foreign national to open Saint Gorge Radiology; that individual fled the country
- Petros Fichidzhyan used foreign nationals' identities to open House of Angels hospice network
- Mohamad Mokbel (Texas) operated 14 pharmacies with different straw owners

**Deceased Physician Credentials:**
- California House of Angels network billed using TWO DECEASED PHYSICIANS' identities
- When one living physician confronted fraudster about unauthorized use, paid $11,000 hush money
- System has no real-time verification of physician status

**The 112 Hospices Problem:**
Los Angeles County had 112 different hospices registered at the **same physical address**. This is mathematically impossible for legitimate operations. Each presumably has separate Medicare enrollment, separate tax ID, separate owner of record—but all at one address.

**Provider Enrollment Failures:**
- No verification of service capacity (facilities, staff, equipment)
- No unannounced site visits during enrollment
- Beneficial ownership not verified, only nominee ownership
- No cross-check against law enforcement investigation lists
- No real-time credential verification

### 2.7 COVID-19 Waivers: Temporary Suspensions That Became Permanent Vulnerabilities

**The Emergency Waivers:**

During COVID-19 pandemic, states suspended multiple safeguards:

| Safeguard Suspended | Justification | Impact | Current Status (Jan 2026) |
|---------------------|---------------|---------|---------------------------|
| Prior Authorization | Enable faster care | CA: Single pharmacy stole $204M in 10 months | Partially restored; many suspensions remain |
| Telemedicine Restrictions | Enable remote care | TX: 1,714 high-risk providers, $127.7M fraud | Payments remain 25x pre-COVID levels |
| Documentation Requirements | Reduce administrative burden | Widespread billing for services not provided | Not fully restored |
| Site Visit Requirements | Protect staff from exposure | No in-person verification for years | Gradual resumption but incomplete |
| Provider Credentialing | Rapid expansion of workforce | Foreign actors purchased hundreds of entities | Standards not fully restored |

**California Prior Authorization Suspension (Detailed):**

January 1, 2022: Medi-Cal Rx transition goes live. DHCS suspends prior authorization for 180 days:
- Pharmacies can bill for high-cost drugs without proving medical necessity
- No verification that medications actually dispensed
- Monte Vista Pharmacy exploits this: $306M billed, $204M paid in 10 months
- Single pharmacy billing "tens of millions per month" should trigger alarms
- Payments continue for 10 months before detection

**Texas Telemedicine Explosion:**

| Period | Monthly Telemedicine Payments | Change from Pre-COVID |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| Pre-COVID (2019) | $800,000 | Baseline |
| April 2020 (Peak) | $43,000,000 | 5,375% increase |
| 2023 Average | $20,000,000 | 2,500% increase |

HHS-OIG identified 1,714 high-risk telehealth providers billing $127.7M fraudulently. Despite this, elevated payment levels continued—safeguards not restored.

### 2.8 The Recovery Rate Problem: Why 85-95% of Stolen Money Disappears

**National Recovery Rate Analysis:**

| State | Estimated Fraud | Documented Recovery | Recovery Rate | Where Money Went |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Minnesota | $9-28B | <$70M | <1% | Overseas ($4M+ documented; $2-4B estimated), domestic (hidden) |
| California | $6-12B/year | $944M/year (FY2024) | ~10% | Gold, overseas (Armenia), shell companies |
| Texas | $4B/year | $203M (FY2023); $350M (FY2022) | 5-15% | India, Egypt, Pakistan, Dubai, domestic |
| Colorado | $2-4B | $48M (SFY2023) | ~2% | India ($41.2M recovered; exceptional), domestic |
| Florida | $4-8B | Unknown | Unknown | International, shell companies |
| Illinois | $2-5B | $51.9M (FY2025) | ~2% | Domestic primarily |
| New York | $5-10B | Unknown | Unknown | China, Singapore, Pakistan, Russia |

**Why Recovery Fails:**

**Domestic Challenges:**
1. **Shell Companies:** Multiple layers obscure beneficial ownership
2. **Real Estate:** Property titled to straw owners; proving fraud proceeds difficult
3. **Gold/Precious Metals:** Portable, untraceable, retains value (CA: $6M+ seized in one case)
4. **Cryptocurrency:** Blockchain analysis possible but difficult; most trails go cold
5. **Time Delay:** Fraudsters move money immediately; detection takes months/years
6. **Asset Seizure Process:** Requires proving asset came from fraud; fraudster can claim legitimate source

**International Impossibility:**

For money transferred overseas:
- **China:** Zero cooperation; no MLAT; once funds enter Chinese banking, trail ends
- **Somalia:** No legal framework; ongoing civil conflict; Treasury investigating terror links
- **Kenya:** Limited cooperation; extradition pending (Ahmednaji Sheikh, 18+ months)
- **Maldives:** Banking secrecy; no cooperation
- **Armenia:** Limited cooperation; Armenian Organized Crime networks operate freely
- **Egypt:** Call centers coordinate fraud; no recovery framework
- **Pakistan:** Billing/marketing companies; limited cooperation
- **Dubai/UAE:** Real estate purchases; difficult to prove fraud proceeds

**The One Exception - India (Texas):**
- Trivikram Reddy transferred $55M to India
- U.S./India cooperation recovered $41.2M (75% recovery rate)
- This is **exceptional** - required extensive bilateral cooperation
- Vast majority of international transfers never recovered

**Historical Rate:** International fraud recovery <1% historically

### 2.9 Organized Crime Penetration: Healthcare as Core Criminal Enterprise

**Why Healthcare Fraud Attracts Organized Crime:**

1. **High Profit Margins:** Billions available through government payment systems
2. **Low Detection Risk:** MCO oversight inadequate; state systems overwhelmed
3. **Lenient Sentences:** Healthcare fraud sentences far shorter than violent crime or drug trafficking
4. **Automatic Payments:** Medicare/Medicaid pay claims automatically if formatted correctly
5. **International Operations:** Money can be moved overseas rapidly
6. **Legitimate Cover:** Operations appear as licensed healthcare businesses

**Armenian Organized Crime (Los Angeles Primary):**

**2010 Historic Case:**
- $163M Medicare fraud scheme
- 73 defendants charged
- 118 fake clinics across 25 states
- DOJ called it "largest Medicare fraud by a single criminal enterprise in history"
- Leadership: "Vor" (godfather) Armen Kazarian (Glendale, CA)
- U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara: Scheme "puts the traditional Mafia to shame"

**Current Operations (2025):**
- Los Angeles County identified as U.S. headquarters
- Two local "avtoritet" (authority figures) in power struggle (2022-present)
- Multiple murder attempts and kidnapping related to territorial control
- Activities beyond healthcare: cargo theft (Amazon), bank fraud, wire fraud, extortion
- May 2025: Healthcare Fraud Strike Force dismantled 5 hospices
- **Current Estimate:** 100+ hospices in LA County likely Armenian network-operated

**Somali Networks (Minnesota Primary):**

**Feeding Our Future:**
- $250-350M documented theft
- Coordinated network of shell nonprofits
- Political donations to MN Democratic officials
- International transfers: Somalia ($1M+), Kenya ($3M+), Turkey (sealed), Maldives ($500K+)
- Treasury investigating Al-Shabaab terrorism financing links
- Pattern: Exploitation of community trust, weaponization of racism accusations

**Russian Transnational Criminal Organizations (New York, Multi-State):**

**Operation Gold Rush:**
- $10.6B in fraudulent claims billed
- DME (Durable Medical Equipment) fraud primary mechanism
- VPN infrastructure to mask actual locations
- Nominee owners throughout U.S.

- Bribed OptumRx employee $188,000 for credentialing assistance
- $160M fraud

**Pattern Recognition:**

All organized crime networks exhibit common characteristics:
- Multi-state operations
- Straw owner structures
- International coordination
- Money laundering sophistication
- Political protection attempts
- Rapid adaptation to enforcement

- Legislative Auditor
- Minnesota Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU)

**The Optum Conflict of Interest:**
- Governor Walz hired Optum State Government Solutions (UnitedHealth subsidiary) as auditor
- UnitedHealthcare was active Minnesota MCO until December 31, 2024
- Audit explicitly excluded MCO claims (80% of Medicaid)
- UnitedHealthcare exited Minnesota December 31, 2024 (weeks after MCO blindspot revelation)

#### 3.1.2 Major Fraud Cases

**FEEDING OUR FUTURE NETWORK - $250-350M**

**The Scheme Structure:**

1. **Entity Creation Phase (2020):**
   - Fraudsters created 250+ shell nonprofit organizations
   - Submitted forged 501(c)(3) documentation to Minnesota Secretary of State
   - Listed fake board members (non-existent or unwitting relatives)
   - No legitimate meal service programs, kitchens, or staff

2. **Program Enrollment Phase (2020):**
   - Shell nonprofits enrolled in Feeding Our Future program (MDE-administered)
   - Program designed to reimburse meal service to low-income children
   - Applications contained forged nonprofit status, false board documentation, fabricated service plans
   - MDE processed applications with minimal verification - no Secretary of State cross-check, no IRS verification, no site visits, no board member verification

3. **Billing Execution Phase (2020-2021):**
   - Monthly reimbursement requests claimed service of thousands of meals
   - Example claims: "Served 5,000 meals in March 2021"
   - Submitted invoices from food suppliers (fake or inflated)
   - Submitted payroll for non-existent staff
   - Amounts: $5,000-$20,000/month per fake nonprofit
   - **Total monthly fraud:** Millions across 250+ entities

4. **Payment Processing Failure:**
   - MDE processed claims with minimal verification
   - No verification of actual meal service
   - No systematic site visits
   - No supplier verification
   - No recipient contact
   - Payments within 2-3 weeks of submission

5. **Money Laundering Phase:**
   - Funds transferred immediately to other accounts
   - International wire transfers
   - Goal: Move money outside U.S. financial system before detection

**Detection Timeline:**
- **July 2019:** MDE audit identifies fraud indicators
- **February 2021:** FBI opens formal investigation (**18-month delay**)
- **January 2022:** FBI raids 15+ locations; 47 initial defendants charged

**Key Perpetrators:**

| Defendant | Stolen | Sentence/Status | Overseas Transfers | Political Connections |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Abdiaziz Shafii Farah | $48M | 28 years (Aug 2025) | Somalia $1M+, Kenya $1.7M+, Turkey (sealed), Maldives | December 11, 2021 meeting with AG Ellison; donated $10K+ 9 days later |
| Abdimajid Nur | $48M | 10 years (2024) | Maldives $500K+ (honeymoon video evidence) | No documented connections |
| Asha Hassan | $14M (autism/EIDBI fraud) | Guilty plea Dec 2025; sentencing pending | Kenya $100Ks | Unknown |
| Najmo Ahmed | $4.2M | Guilty plea Feb 2025; sentencing pending | China $1.1M+ to Shaoxing Aifan Textile Co. | Unknown |
| Abdifatah Yusuf | $7.2M (housing fraud) | Convicted 2024; **OVERTURNED Nov 2025** by Judge West | Sealed | Unknown |

**Sentencing Disparity Analysis:**
- Farah and Nur stole nearly identical amounts ($48M each)
- Farah received 28 years; Nur received 10 years
- Primary difference: Farah had documented political connections (AG meeting, donations)
- Pattern suggests political connections influenced sentencing outcomes

**HOUSING STABILIZATION SERVICES FRAUD - $7.2M+**

**Abdifatah Yusuf Case:**
- Forged lease agreements for emergency housing assistance
- False claims of housing emergencies
- Exploited weak verification systems
- Convicted 2024 with strong evidence
- **Judge Jeannine Minge West overturned conviction November 2025**
- Basis for overturn: Sealed procedural grounds
- Case remanded for retrial or dismissal
- **Defendant whereabouts unknown as of January 2026**

**AUTISM/EIDBI SERVICES FRAUD - $14M+**

**Asha Hassan Case:**
- Created fake autism services provider
- Submitted false Early Intensive Developmental and Behavioral Intervention (EIDBI) claims
- Billed for therapy sessions never provided
- Forged therapist credentials and service records
- Guilty plea December 2025
- Overseas transfers to Kenya
- Sentencing pending (January 2026)

#### 3.1.3 The Political Protection Mechanism

**The Ellison-Farah Meeting (December 11, 2021):**

**Documented Facts:**
- **Date:** December 11, 2021
- **Participants:** Attorney General Keith Ellison, Abdiaziz Shafii Farah (fraudster under active FBI investigation), other conspirators
- **Evidence:** Audio recording (Defense Exhibit 710 in federal trial)
- **Status:** Farah already under FBI investigation for $48M theft
- **9 Days Later (December 20, 2021):** Farah donated $10,000+ to Ellison campaign
- **January 2022:** FBI raids occur; Feeding Our Future shut down

**Significance:**
The top state law enforcement official met privately with an active federal criminal target under investigation for $48M fraud, nine days before that target made substantial campaign donations, and less than one month before FBI raids. The meeting appears to be an attempt to head off investigation.

**Campaign Donations:**

| Donor | Recipient | Amount | Status | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Liban Alishire (FOF defendant) | AG Keith Ellison | $2,500 | Returned 2022 after pressure | Later pled guilty |
| Abdiaziz Farah + associates | AG Keith Ellison | $10,000+ | **Not returned** (Jan 2026) | 9 days after Dec 11 meeting |
| FOF defendants | Sen. Omar Fateh (D-Minneapolis) | $11,000+ | Returned 2022 after court pressure | Fateh called Ellison on behalf of defendants |
| Various FOF defendants | MN Democratic officials | $50,000+ | Most returned quietly or retained | Likely additional unreported donations |

**Suppression Tactics:**

1. **Investigation Delay (18 months):**
   - MDE identified fraud July 2019
   - FBI didn't open investigation until February 2021
   - Whistleblower testimony indicates pressure to avoid "disrupting" program
   - "Cultural sensitivity" concerns cited
   - Result: $50M+ additional fraud during delay

2. **Weaponization of Racism Accusations:**
   - FOF defendants claimed investigators targeting Somali community
   - Community leaders echoed claims
   - Media amplified message
   - Politicians pressured investigators
   - Created chilling effect on oversight

3. **Whistleblower Retaliation:**
   - **480+ documented retaliation cases**
   - Methods: Firing, removal, blacklisting, character attacks, legal threats
   - Example: State employees reporting fraud were transferred/terminated
   - Federal investigators faced political pressure

4. **Agency Pressure to Continue Payments:**
   - State agencies continued payments to suspected fraudsters during FBI investigation
   - Claimed "legal obligation" to maintain payments
   - Evidence suggests political pressure prevented suspension

**Key Political Figures:**

| Official | Position | Actions | Status (Jan 2026) |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Keith Ellison | Attorney General | Dec 11 meeting with Farah; received donations; returned some after pressure | Subpoenaed by House Oversight; no charges filed |
| Omar Fateh | State Senator (D-Minneapolis) | Received $11K+ from defendants; called Ellison on their behalf | No charges; Senate seat retained |
| Ilhan Omar | U.S. Representative | Sponsored MEALS Act enabling FOF fraud | No charges; "absolutely no regrets" (Dec 2025) |
| Tim Walz | Governor | Hired Optum (conflict of interest); audit excluded MCOs; alleged MCO audit suppression | Subpoenaed by House Oversight; no charges |

#### 3.1.4 The MCO Audit Blindspot (Detailed)

**The Structural Design:**

Minnesota's Medicaid operates through two completely separate payment channels:

**Channel 1: Direct DHS Payments (20% = $1.9B)**
- Direct state payments to nonprofits/providers
- Covered by Optum audit
- Examples: Feeding Our Future, housing services, autism/EIDBI
- **Fraud Detection:** Reactive audits identified $250-371M in fraud

**Channel 2: MCO Capitation (80% = $8.0B)**
- State pays MCOs fixed monthly amount per enrollee
- MCOs process all internal claims
- **NOT covered by Optum audit (explicitly excluded)**
- **Independent oversight: ZERO**
- **MCOs audit themselves**

**The Two-Channel Exploitation:**

Fraudsters could exploit BOTH channels simultaneously:
- Submit charges to direct channel (visible, monitored)
- Submit same or different claims through MCOs (invisible, unmonitored)
- Known FBI investigation subjects continued billing MCOs during prosecution
- MCOs didn't cross-reference with law enforcement
- No coordination between MCO fraud detection and FBI

**Documented MCO Failures:**

**Blue Plus:**
- **Fines:** $13M+ (2018-2020)
- **Violations:**
  - Failed to detect provider fraud
  - Continued paying fraudsters despite evidence
  - Failed to report fraud to authorities (legal requirement)
  - Claims processing failures: Paid claims lacking documentation, exceeding limits, for services never rendered
  - Provider verification failures: Failed to verify credentials; paid unqualified providers
- **Status:** Remains operational; minimal changes; processing $2.33B annually with same systems

**All MCOs (Legislative Auditor 2022):**
- **UCare, Blue Plus, HealthPartners, Medica, PrimeWest:** Allowed Personal Care Assistants to exceed legal service hour limits
- **HealthPartners, Medica, South Country, UCare:** Failed to ensure required supervision
- **Medica, UCare:** Failed to limit service amounts
- **All MCOs:** Timesheet compliance failures
- **Result:** No significant enforcement; corrective action plans issued but not verified; oversight unchanged

**UCare - PITSTOP 66 Medical Transportation:**
- 30+ defendants charged for fraudulent medical transportation
- UCare allowed 60-mile transports without preauthorization
- Failed to verify medical necessity
- No basic controls on payment processing
- **Result:** Fraudsters prosecuted; MCO paid fines; system continues with same vulnerabilities

**Estimated MCO Fraud:**

| Fraud Rate | Annual Estimate | 5-Year Total (2020-2025) |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Conservative (5%) | $400M/year | $2.0B |
| Realistic (10%) | $800M/year | $4.0B |
| Higher (15%) | $1.2B/year | $6.0B |

**Why 10% is Realistic:**
- Legislative Auditor found systematic non-compliance by ALL MCOs
- Known fraudsters continued operating undetected
- Internal controls failed repeatedly
- Other states with similar systems document 8-12% fraud rates post-detection

**Total Minnesota Fraud Estimate:**
- **Visible (Direct Channel):** $291-421M
- **Invisible (MCO Channel):** $5.0-5.2B (likely)
- **Total:** $5.3-5.6B

**Visible fraud represents only 5-8% of total; invisible MCO fraud represents 92-95%**

#### 3.1.5 International Money Trail

**China - $1.1M+ (Unrecoverable):**

**Najmo Ahmed Transfers:**
- **Amount:** $1.1M+ (2021)
- **Primary Recipient:** Shaoxing Aifan Textile Co., Ltd. (Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province)
- **Business Type:** Textile import/export (100+ shipments to India in trade data)
- **Method:** Wire transfers through multiple accounts
- **Total Laundered:** $1.38M through her accounts
- **Other Recipients:** Additional foreign textile companies (unnamed)
- **Status:** Pleaded guilty February 2025; awaiting sentencing
- **Recovery:** ZERO

**Why China is "Black Hole":**
- Chinese banking regulations + deliberate non-cooperation = impenetrable wall
- U.S. Treasury has no MLAT provisions requiring Chinese assistance
- Once funds enter Chinese banking system, investigative trail terminates
- No diplomatic pressure can compel cooperation

**If Ahmed sent $1.1M to one company, likely 5-10x more through other Chinese fronts = $5-10M+ total to China**

**Somalia - $1M+ (Terror Investigation):**

**Abdiaziz Shafii Farah Transfers:**
- **Amount:** 6+ transfers totaling $1M+
- **Destination:** Mogadishu, Somalia
- **Red Flag:** Text message: "Please send $1000 to Mogadishu Bakara"
- **Bakara Market:** Al-Shabaab territory; site of 1993 "Black Hawk Down" incident
- **Pattern:** Multiple Mogadishu references in communications

**U.S. Treasury Investigation:**
- Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (January 2026): "Millions of taxpayer dollars confirmed sent to Somalia...could have potentially been diverted to terrorist organization al-Shabaab"
- **Agencies Involved:** Treasury, FinCEN, FBI, State Department
- **Actions:** 4 money services under investigation; Geographic Targeting Order tracking $3,000+ transfers
- **Status:** No terrorism financing charges filed (January 2026)
- **Challenge:** Distinguishing legitimate family remittances from terror financing

**Kenya - $3M+ (Partially Traceable):**

**Primary Transfers:**
- **From:** Abdiaziz Farah
- **To:** Ahmednaji Sheikh (Kenya)
- **Amount:** $1.7M+

**Ahmednaji Sheikh:**
- **Status:** Indicted September 2025
- **Location:** Kenya; awaiting extradition
- **Expected Charges:** Wire fraud, conspiracy, money laundering
- **Current Status:** In Kenya; extradition delayed 18+ months

**Recovery Challenges:**
- Kenya has weak U.S. cooperation
- Funds moved to personal accounts (difficult to trace)
- Real estate purchases (illiquid; hard to identify as fraud proceeds)
- Extradition process slow

**Recovery Prospects:** Partial recovery ($500K-$1M) possible if extradition succeeds and MLAT cooperation secured

**Maldives - $500K+ (Unrecoverable):**

**Abdimajid Nur Transfers:**
- **Amount:** $500K+
- **Method:** Personal transfers during honeymoon (July 2021)
- **Evidence:** Video captured honeymoon trip; transfers documented
- **Purpose:** Money laundering through personal travel expenses

**Why Unrecoverable:**
- Maldives has no MLAT with U.S.
- Actively discourages law enforcement inquiries
- Protects banking secrecy
- No diplomatic leverage

**Turkey - Amounts Sealed:**

**Abdiaziz Farah:**
- Turkey transfers documented in indictment
- Specific amounts sealed
- Investigation ongoing

**Total Overseas:**
- **Documented:** $4M+ (China $1.1M, Somalia $1M, Kenya $3M, Maldives $500K, Turkey sealed)
- **Estimated Total:** $2-4B (largely untraced)
  - Indicators: Banking pattern analysis showing deposits followed by rapid withdrawals; cash smuggling (defendants photographed with large cash at airports); foreign real estate purchases; cryptocurrency transfers (unconfirmed); hawala network use (no banking records)

**Recovery Rate:** <1% of overseas transfers ever recovered

#### 3.1.6 Systemic Failures

**Minnesota Department of Education (MDE):**

| Failure Point | What Should Have Happened | What Actually Happened | Impact |
|---------------|---------------------------|------------------------|--------|
| Entity Verification (2020) | Verify nonprofit registration, IRS 501(c)(3) status, board members, physical capacity | Accepted applications without verification; no cross-checks | 250+ fraudulent entities approved |
| Claim Verification (2020-2021) | Verify meals served, supplier invoices, payroll, service location | Processed claims based on submitted documentation alone; no verification | $250M+ stolen before detection |
| Ongoing Monitoring (2020-2021) | Compare meal counts month-to-month; cross-check with school enrollment; random site visits | No ongoing monitoring after approval; organizations submitted claims indefinitely | Fraud operated 12-18 months undetected |
| Whistleblower Response (Alleged) | Immediate investigation; emergency site visits; suspend organizations; cooperate with law enforcement | Staff who raised concerns allegedly discouraged; "cultural sensitivity" invoked | Fraud continued longer than necessary |

**Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS):**
- **Knowledge:** By 2021, aware of FBI investigation
- **Action:** Continued payments to suspected fraudsters
- **Claimed Reason:** "Legal obligation" to maintain payments
- **Actual Reason:** Political pressure prevented suspension

**Minnesota Department of Health (MDH):**
- Blue Plus violations not enforced despite 8 corrective action plans
- Legislative Auditor findings not acted upon
- No independent MCO claims audit
- Weak provider credentialing standards
- No fraud communication protocol with FBI

**Minnesota Legislative Auditor:**
- **Findings (2022):** All major MCOs violated service hour limits, supervision requirements, timesheet compliance
- **Action:** Issued report with recommendations
- **Result:** Recommendations ignored; no enforcement mechanism; industry lobbying; budget constraints; lack of public attention

**Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI):**
- **Investigation Start:** February 2021 (14 months after initial MDE finding)
- **Challenges:**
  - Volume of suspects (100+)
  - International coordination complexity
  - Investigation expansion (direct + housing + autism)
  - Political pressure to slow investigation
  - Character attacks on investigators

**Federal Judge Jeannine Minge West:**
- Overturned Yusuf housing fraud conviction (November 2025)
- Procedural grounds sealed
- **Questions:**
  - Why Yusuf when other judges affirmed similar convictions?
  - What procedural issue warrants conviction overturn?
  - Pattern of sympathy to defendants?
  - Have other defendants appealed hoping for similar outcomes?

**State Auditor:**
- Limited authority: Cannot audit MCO internal operations
- Findings: MCO oversight by state has gaps
- Follow-up: No legislative action on recommendations

#### 3.1.7 Minnesota Summary

**Primary Fraud Mechanisms:**
1. Shell nonprofit creation exploiting weak verification
2. Systematic overbilling through false documentation
3. MCO channel exploitation (80% of Medicaid unaudited)
4. International money laundering
5. Political protection through donations

**Primary Beneficiaries:**
1. Criminal networks (Somali-led Feeding Our Future; others)
2. MCOs indirectly (fraud-inflated capitation rates; continued contracts despite failures)
3. Politicians receiving donations
4. Overseas recipients

**Primary Failures:**
1. MDE: 18-month delay; weak verification
2. DHS: Continued payments during investigation
3. MDH: Unenforced MCO violations
4. Optum audit design: 80% exclusion
5. Political system: Donations → protection
6. Judicial: Conviction overturn

**Reforms Needed:**
1. Mandatory MCO-MFCU referral pipelines with penalties for non-reporting
2. Independent audit of ALL Medicaid spending (not 20%)
3. Real-time provider verification
4. Ban political donations from Medicaid contractors
5. Whistleblower protection enforcement
6. Restore suspended COVID safeguards

### 3.2 CALIFORNIA: "Another Minnesota"

#### 3.2.1 System Structure

**Medicaid Overview (Medi-Cal):**
- **Enrollment:** 14+ million beneficiaries (largest state Medicaid program nationally)
- **Annual Budget:** $125B+ (FY 2024-2025)
- **Administration:** Department of Health Care Services (DHCS)
- **Model:** Comprehensive managed care; 80%+ through MCOs
- **Pharmacy:** Medi-Cal Rx transitioned to Magellan (Centene subsidiary) January 2022

**Major MCOs:**
- Health Net (Centene subsidiary)
- Blue Shield of California
- L.A. Care Health Plan
- Kaiser Permanente
- Molina Healthcare
- Anthem Blue Cross
- UnitedHealthcare (various subsidiaries)

**Oversight Bodies:**
- DHCS (Department of Health Care Services)
- California Attorney General Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU)
- California State Auditor
- CMS (federal oversight)

**Leadership:**
- **Michelle Baass:** DHCS Director (appointed September 10, 2021 by Governor Newsom)
  - Previous: Undersecretary CA Health and Human Services (2018-2021); Deputy Secretary Office of Program and Fiscal Affairs (2017-2018)
  - Earlier career: Manager/consultant at Accenture (1996-2004)
- **Rob Bonta:** Attorney General
- **Gavin Newsom:** Governor

#### 3.2.2 Political Connections and Pay-to-Play

**The Core Pattern: Donations → Contracts**

**Open the Books Investigation:**
- **979 state vendors** gave **$10,561,828** to Gavin Newsom (2010, 2018, recall, 2022 campaigns)
- Those same vendors received **$6,201,978,173** in state payments
- **Ratio: 587:1** (For every $1 donated, $587 received in contracts)

**Blue Shield of California - 16-Year Relationship:**

| Year | Donation | Purpose | What Followed |
|------|----------|---------|---------------|
| 2005 | $25,000 | Project Homeless Connect (Newsom as SF Mayor) | Established relationship |
| 2002-2018 | ~$23M total | Campaigns and causes | Political ascent |
| 2019 | $100,000 | Newsom inaugural fund | Administration access |
| Jan 2020 | **$20 million** | Project Homekey (homelessness fund) | See below |
| 2020 | $300,000 | Commission on Future of Work nonprofit | Policy influence |
| 2020 | **$15 million** | COVID vaccination contract | **No-bid award** |

**The Critical Sequence (2020):**
1. January: Blue Shield donates $20M to Newsom homelessness fund
2. Same year: Blue Shield CEO recruited to shape COVID-19 testing strategy
3. Blue Shield receives vaccine distribution contract **without competitive bidding**

**December 2022 Backroom Deal:**
- Long-planned competitive bidding among commercial health plans
- Blue Shield initially shut out
- **"Backroom agreement" reversed bidding results**
- Blue Shield given San Diego County
- Health Net (Centene) was planned removal from LA County for being "among lowest performers"
- Health Net allowed to stay
- Official explanation: "balance enrollment"
- **Reality:** Political relationships override competitive merit

**Centene Donation History:**
- Gave Newsom **$242,550** in donations
- CEO Michael Neidorff personally donated **$121,800**
- Subsidiary (Health Net) benefited from backroom deal

**Major Healthcare Company Donations:**

| Company | Donations | State Payments Received | Ratio |
|---------|-----------|-------------------------|-------|
| Anthem Blue Cross | $69,305 | $844,875,535 | 12,191:1 |
| Centene/Health Net | $242,550 | $206,155,778 | 850:1 |
| Kaiser Permanente | $35,910 | $172,217,805 | 4,795:1 |
| Blue Shield | $102,550 + $20M behested | $74,283,100 | Complex |
| UnitedHealth | $130,000 + $100K inaugural | $315M+ no-bid | 1,369:1 |

**Combined:** Major healthcare companies gave $691,615 direct + $20M behested; received $1.9B+ in state payments

**No-Bid Contract Pattern:**

| Donor | Donation | No-Bid Contract | Value | Connection |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| BYD (China) | $40,000 (president) | Masks | $990M + $316M extension | Chinese company, minimal US presence, largest state contract |
| UnitedHealth | $189,000 | Testing + data tracking | $177M + $315M | Two separate contracts without competition |
| Blue Shield | $23M over time | Vaccine distribution | $15M | CEO advisory role first |
| Bloom Energy | Favorable press | Ventilator refurbishment | Unknown | CEO praised Newsom at press conference |

**Behested Payments - The Legal Loophole:**

"Behested payments" = Donations that elected officials solicit from private parties for third-party causes. Unlike campaign contributions (regulated, capped), behested payments have **no limits** and less scrutiny.

**The Explosion:**
- **2019:** Newsom solicited ~$12M in behested payments
- **2020:** Newsom solicited ~$227M in behested payments
- **Increase:** 19x more than previous year

**Top 2020 Donors:**
- Facebook: $27M
- Blue Shield: $20M
- Google: $10M

All have significant interests before state government.

**First Partner's Charity:**
Jennifer Siebel Newsom's nonprofit "The Representation Project" received donations from state vendors while those vendors received billions in state payments (documented by Open the Books, Sacramento Bee, Washington Post).

**Attorney General Rob Bonta on Fraud:**

When Trump administration announced Medicaid investigations, Bonta responded:
> "The whole idea that there's waste, fraud, and abuse is contrived. It's manufactured. It's invented. It's a catchall phrase they use to justify their predetermined anti-immigrant agenda."

This blanket dismissal of fraud as "contrived" and "manufactured" came from the state's chief law enforcement officer responsible for prosecuting such fraud - **identical to Minnesota's political deflection pattern**.

**Assembly Health Committee Chair Mia Bonta:**
- Wife of Attorney General Rob Bonta
- Criticized for not recusing herself in votes relating to husband's agency
- **Structural conflict:** Person overseeing healthcare legislation married to person prosecuting healthcare fraud

**Campaign Donations vs. Single-Payer Healthcare:**

Newsom campaigned supporting single-payer healthcare. His top insurance donors **actively oppose** such legislation:
- Blue Shield: $99,000+ to campaigns, $2.7M to CA Democratic Party
- Anthem: $78,000 to campaigns, $770,000 to CA Democratic Party
- UnitedHealth: $130,000 to campaigns, $513,000 to state party

All three participate in coalition claiming single-payer "would create a new and exorbitantly expensive government bureaucracy."

#### 3.2.3 The Monte Vista Pharmacy Fraud - How Prior Authorization Suspension Enabled $204M Theft

**The Decision Chain Creating the Opportunity:**

**Step 1 (January 7, 2019):** Governor Newsom signs Executive Order N-01-19 ordering transition of Medi-Cal pharmacy from managed care to fee-for-service

**Step 2 (December 13, 2019):** DHCS awards Medi-Cal Rx contract to **Magellan Medicaid Administration**

**Step 3 (January 2021):** **Centene acquires Magellan** - creating massive conflict of interest (Centene operates MCOs and pharmacies; now manages state prescription system for all competitors)

**Step 4 (September 10, 2021):** **Michelle Baass appointed DHCS Director** by Newsom

**Step 5 (January 1, 2022):** Medi-Cal Rx goes live; **prior authorization requirements SUSPENDED**

**The Critical Decision:**
DHCS Pharmacy Transition Policy stated: "DHCS will not require any PA during the 180-day period for covered Medi-Cal pharmacy benefits billed on pharmacy claims."

**This meant:** Pharmacies could bill for high-cost drugs **without any verification** that prescriptions were medically necessary or medications were actually dispensed.

**The Fraud Mechanism (May 2022 - March 2023):**

**The Players:**
- **Kyrollos Mekail** (36, Moreno Valley): Licensed CA pharmacist; owner and pharmacist-in-charge of Monte Vista Pharmacy (Montclair)
- **Co-Schemer 1**: Received kickbacks up to 40% of revenue for referring prescriptions
- **Co-Schemer 2**: Medical professional who signed prescriptions for payment

**The Step-by-Step Operation:**

1. **Suspended prior authorization** = Monte Vista can bill expensive medications without proving medical necessity

2. **Co-Schemer 1 identifies** Medi-Cal beneficiaries whose insurance can be billed

3. **Co-Schemer 2 signs prescriptions** for those patients (receiving payment per signature)

4. **Monte Vista bills Medi-Cal** for 19 expensive, non-contracted drugs containing low-cost generic ingredients
   - Many prescriptions medically unnecessary
   - Many never actually dispensed to patients
   - Some medications: Folite tablets (vitamin available over-the-counter)

5. **Medi-Cal pays claims** because prior authorization safeguard removed

**The Numbers:**
- **Fraud Period:** May 2022 to March 2023 (10 months)
- **Amount Billed:** $306,521,392
- **Amount Paid:** $204,032,151
- **Kickbacks Paid:** $36 million (disguised as "consulting services")
- **Kickback Rate:** Up to 40% of revenue from fraudulent claims

**The Billing Pattern That Should Have Triggered Alarms:**
Monte Vista billing "tens of millions of dollars per month" for high-reimbursement generic drugs. **A single pharmacy billing amounts placing it among highest-volume pharmacies in the state should have triggered automated fraud detection.** Instead, payments continued for **ten months**.

**July 2025 Expansion:**
Federal prosecutors charged additional co-conspirators:
- **Marshall Randall** (Orange County): Prior federal convictions; previously worked with Michael D. Drobot in Pacific Hospital kickback scandal
- **Patricia Anderson** (57, West Hills): Charged with health care fraud

Network billed Medi-Cal **$269 million**; paid **$178 million** (May 2022 - April 2023).

Randall and others **laundered proceeds** by transferring funds to third parties to pay kickbacks, promote scheme, and conceal from law enforcement.

**Status:** Mekail pleaded guilty August 2024; awaiting sentencing

**The Centene/Magellan Disaster:**

**February 2022 Botched Rollout:**
- **95,000+ Californians** not receiving medications
- Healthcare providers reported "life and death situations"
- Medi-Cal MCOs protested: Centene-owned system gave Centene access to all competitors' pharmacy data

**The Conflict:**
California Globe reported Newsom awarded Magellan contract despite Centene acquisition "gives Centene access to all of their competitor's pharmacy data."

**Centene's Fraud History While Receiving CA Contract:**

| State | Settlement Amount | Year | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|------|-------|
| Illinois | $56.7M | 2021 | Pharmacy overbilling |
| Arkansas | $15.2M | 2021 | Pharmacy overbilling |
| Multiple states | $1B+ reserve | 2021 | Bloomberg Law: Centene "set aside just over $1 billion to cover future anticipated settlements" |

**California awarded billions-worth contract to Centene subsidiary while parent company simultaneously reserving $1B for fraud settlements in other states.**

#### 3.2.4 The 112 Hospices at One Address

**Congressional Finding (December 2025):**

House Energy and Commerce Committee:
> "Auditors have reported an unprecedented jump in home health and hospice fraud in Los Angeles County, California—**including one report showing 112 different hospices located at the same physical address.**"

**This single statistic encapsulates California's hospice fraud crisis.** Hospice care requires physical facilities, medical staff, patient care infrastructure. 112 separate hospice companies at one address is **mathematically impossible** for legitimate operations.

**LA County Hospice Explosion:**

| Year | LA County Hospices | Change from Baseline |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 2010 | ~115 | Baseline |
| 2022 | 1,841 | **+1,589%** |
| 2025 | ~2,889 (statewide); moratorium in effect | Continuing growth |

**National Context:**
- LA County hospice growth (1983-2024) **exceeded combined growth of 36 states**
- 15 new hospices received Medicare certification, **all operating from same two-story building** in Los Angeles
- **94% of CA hospice agencies are for-profit** (versus nonprofit hospices with different incentives)

**Home Health Agency Explosion (Same Pattern):**

| Metric | United States (2019-2023) | LA County (2019-2023) |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Change in HHAs | 8,838 → 8,280 (**-6%**) | 896 → 1,309 (**+46%**) |
| New enrollments (5 years) | Varied by region | 1,400+ |
| Share of CA HHAs | — | 50%+ |
| Share of National HHAs | 100% | ~14% |

While U.S. saw 6% **decrease**, LA County saw 46% **increase**. LA County now contains:
- **>50% of all California home health agencies**
- **~14% of all U.S. home health agencies**

**Why This Matters:**
This is not organic healthcare demand growth. This is organized criminal networks establishing fraudulent entities to bill Medicare/Medicaid.

#### 3.2.5 Armenian Organized Crime - Healthcare as Core Enterprise

**Historical Foundation (2010):**

**The $163 Million Medicare Fraud Scheme:**
- **73 defendants** charged
- **118 fake clinics** across 25 states
- **Leadership:** "Vor" (godfather) Armen Kazarian (Glendale, CA)
- **U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara:** Scheme "puts the traditional Mafia to shame"
- **DOJ:** "Largest Medicare fraud by a single criminal enterprise in history"
- **Paid before detection:** $35 million

**Current Operations (2025):**

**Los Angeles County = U.S. Headquarters**

Federal court filings (2025) identify Armenian Organized Crime as "Russian mafia-affiliated transnational criminal organization" that has made **Los Angeles County center of U.S. operations**.

**Power Struggle (2022-Present):**
- Two local "avtoritet" (authority figures) in territorial control struggle
- Multiple murder attempts
- Kidnapping incidents
- Violence over healthcare fraud territory

**Activities Beyond Healthcare:**
- Cargo theft (targeting Amazon/online retailers)
- Bank fraud
- Wire fraud
- Extortion
- Kidnapping

**Why Healthcare Fraud Attractive:**
- Medicare/Medi-Cal automatically pay claims
- Penalties far less severe than violent crimes
- Billions available
- Can operate under legitimate business cover

**May 2025 Enforcement Action:**
Healthcare Fraud Strike Force **dismantled 5 hospices** in greater LA following multi-year investigation into Armenian Organized Crime.

**Current Estimate:** 100+ LA County hospices likely Armenian network-operated

#### 3.2.6 Major Fraud Cases

**HOUSE OF ANGELS HOSPICE NETWORK - $16M+**

**Sentencing Complete:**

| Defendant | Sentence | Restitution Ordered | Role |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|------|
| **Petros Fichidzhyan** | **12 years** | **$17,129,060** | Mastermind/organizer |
| Juan Carlos Esparza | 57 months | $1,825,012 | House of Angels owner |
| Karpis Srapyan | 57 months | $3,203,574 | Co-schemer |
| Mihran Panosyan | 57 months | $4,680,146 | Money launderer |
| Susanna Harutyunyan | 15 months + **deportation** | $2,822,963 | Money launderer |

**Total Medicare fraud:** Nearly $16M through 4 sham hospices (July 2019 - January 2023)

**The Scheme Methodology:**

1. **Foreign Nationals as Straw Owners:**
   - Used foreign nationals' personal identifying information
   - Names on Medicare applications, bank accounts, property leases, cell phones
   - Straw owners did not control businesses

2. **Bank Accounts Under False Identities:**
   - Opened accounts in foreign nationals' names
   - Received Medicare payments
   - Created separation between fraudsters and proceeds

3. **Deceased Physicians' Identities:**
   - Billed Medicare using names of doctors who never treated patients
   - **Including TWO DECEASED PHYSICIANS**
   - When one living doctor confronted Fichidzhyan about unauthorized use: **Paid $11,000 hush money**

4. **Billing for Non-Existent Services:**
   - Billed for medically unnecessary services
   - Patients did not meet terminal diagnosis criteria
   - Services never provided

5. **Money Laundering:**
   - Moved funds through **dozen shell and third-party bank accounts**
   - Maintained fraudulent IDs, bank documents, checkbooks, credit/debit cards at residential properties
   - Fichidzhyan alone laundered **$5.3M+** through shell companies
   - Also ran separate **$1M+ home health fraud** using another doctor's stolen identity

**Government Seizures:**
- $2,920,383 seized from bank accounts
- Home purchased with fraudulent proceeds ordered forfeited
- Two additional homes ordered forfeited at sentencing (May 2025)

**The Recovery Gap:**
Total restitution ordered ($29M+) vastly exceeds amount seized ($2.9M + homes). **Most fraud proceeds unrecoverable.**

**SHAKLIAN/ALEXSANIAN NETWORK - $54M (Pending)**

**Arrested:** October 9, 2024 (24-count indictment)

| Defendant | Charges | Potential Sentence |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Sophia Shaklian** (36, LA) | 16 counts healthcare fraud, 4 counts money laundering | 10 years each healthcare fraud; 20 years each money laundering |
| **Alex Alexsanian** (47, Burbank) | 1 count conspiracy, 3 counts concealment money laundering | 20 years each count |

**The Scheme (March 2019 - August 2024):**

Shaklian used **7 healthcare providers:**
- Chateau d'Lumina Hospice
- Saint Gorge Radiology
- Console Hospice
- Hope Diagnostics
- Direct Imaging & Diagnostics
- Lab One
- Labtech
- Lifescan Diagnostics

**Numbers:**
- **Total Claims Submitted:** $54+ million
- **Amount Paid by Medicare:** $23+ million

**The Money Laundering Innovation - GOLD:**

1. Shaklian created **synthetic identity: "Varsenic Babaian"**
2. Medicare funds transferred to accounts under fake name
3. Alexsanian instructed **foreign national** to open Saint Gorge Radiology
4. **That foreign national has since FLED THE COUNTRY**
5. Conspirators **purchased $6+ million in gold bars and coins** to launder proceeds

**Why Gold Works for Money Laundering:**
- Portable
- Retains value
- Doesn't require bank accounts
- Can be sold internationally
- Difficult for investigators to trace

**Status:** Pending trial (January 2026)

**GERARDO SANTILLAN HOME HEALTH NETWORK - $60M**

**Status:** Pending
**Amount:** $60 million fraud
**Details:** Under investigation; charges expected

**OSCAR ABRONS PRESCRIPTION DIVERSION - $20M**

**Status:** Pending
**Amount:** $20 million
**Type:** Prescription drug diversion scheme
**Details:** Under investigation

#### 3.2.7 The "Churn and Burn" Method

**CMS Documentation:**

CMS has identified a specific pattern used by hospice fraud networks:

> "A new hospice opens and starts billing, but once that hospice is audited or reaches its statutory yearly payment limit, it shuts down, keeps the money, buys a new Medicare billing number, transfers its patients over to the new Medicare billing number, and starts billing again."

**This explains the explosive hospice growth:** Many are not new organizations but the **same criminal networks cycling through new identities**.

**Example Pattern:**
- Criminal network operates as "ABC Hospice" (bills $2M; shuts down when audited)
- Reopens as "XYZ Hospice" with new Medicare number (bills $2M; shuts down)
- Reopens as "123 Hospice" with new Medicare number (bills $2M; shuts down)
- Pattern continues indefinitely

**A single fraud organization might sequentially operate as 5, 10, or more "different" hospices, each billing until detection, then reopening under new name.**

**112 hospices at one address likely represents:** ~10-20 actual criminal operations cycling through multiple identities over time.

#### 3.2.8 Whistleblower Cases - The Real Detection System

**The Pattern:** California's fraud detection relies overwhelmingly on **whistleblowers**, not state-initiated investigations or MCO referrals. This reveals critical failure: official detection mechanisms don't work.

**GOLD COAST HEALTH PLAN - $70.7 MILLION (2022)**

**Whistleblowers:**
- **Atul Maithel:** Former controller (chief accounting officer)
- **Andre Galvan:** Former director of member services

**The Fraud:**
Gold Coast realized it had Adult Expansion money from ACA that would be returned to CA if not spent on patient care. Rather than returning excess funds as required:

1. Providers produced "arbitrary lists" of services claimed
2. Lists included services not provided, duplicative services already reimbursed, pre-determined payments not reflecting fair market value
3. "Additional services" billed: phone calls, health fairs, hotel vouchers
4. Providers sent lists; received checks
5. Gold Coast appeared compliant; actually funneled money to preferred relationships

**Timeline:**
- **2015:** Qui tam lawsuit filed
- **2016:** First Amended Complaint
- **2019:** Second Amended Complaint
- **August 2022:** $70.7M settlement

**Seven years** from filing to settlement. Both whistleblowers were **former employees** - had to leave positions to pursue case.

**CENCAL HEALTH - $95.5 MILLION (2023)**

**Whistleblower:** Dr. Julio Bordas

**The Fraud:**
CenCal Health inflated Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) reported to DHCS. MLR measures what percentage of premium revenue insurer spends on actual healthcare versus administrative costs/profit.

By inflating reported MLR, CenCal avoided refunding tens of millions in surplus funding that should have been returned to state.

**Complexity:** Required **seven separate settlements** with CenCal and seven hospitals/clinics that participated.

**Edward Arens (Phillips & Cohen LLP):** "Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) inflation takes scarce healthcare dollars away from patients who need it and harms taxpayers."

**Additional Whistleblower Cases:**

| Case | Settlement | Whistleblower | Exposed | Years to Resolve | Reward |
|------|-----------|---------------|---------|------------------|--------|
| Cottage Health | $5M | Dr. Julio Bordas | Improper Medi-Cal billing | Multi-year | $950,000 |
| Alta Vista Healthcare | $3.825M | Neyirys Orozco (former accounting employee) | Illegal kickbacks to physicians | Multi-year | $581,094 |
| CVS Pharmacy | $18.2M | CVS pharmacist (filed 2019) | Dispensed drugs for unapproved conditions | 6 years | ~$3.3M |
| ReNew Health | $7.084M | Bay Area partners | False COVID-19 Waiver claims | 4 years | $1,204,280 |

**Total Recovered (These Cases):** ~$200 million

**CVS Details:**
- Did not properly confirm/document required diagnoses for "Code 1" drugs
- Dispensed drugs for unapproved conditions
- Knowingly billed Medi-Cal despite knowing prescriptions didn't meet requirements

**ReNew Health Details:**
- **First False Claims Act case** related to COVID-19 Waiver Program abuse
- ReNew Health owns dozens of CA nursing facilities
- Submitted false Medicare claims representing residents needed skilled care based on COVID exposure when they didn't
- Exploited pandemic emergency measures

**CONTRA COSTA HEALTH ECM PROGRAM - ONGOING**

**Whistleblower:** Nurse (current employee)

**Allegations:**
- Enhanced Care Management program "abandoned medical assistance altogether"
- Case managers instructed focus only on social needs; ignore clinical needs
- Cutting corners allows inflating caseload sizes to obtain more state funding
- Contra Costa Health received **$2.5B in Medi-Cal revenue** (2022-2023 combined)

**Fraud Mechanism Explained:**
"It gives them an excuse to really inflate caseload sizes. Because by ignoring clinical needs there, then it's okay; it's totally manageable to manage just the social needs of 100 patients."

**State Response:** DHCS said will "continue to monitor" - whistleblower "not confident in state's response"

**The Whistleblower Pattern:**

| Case | Settlement | Years | Whistleblower Status |
|------|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| Gold Coast | $70.7M | 7 | Former employees |
| CenCal | $95.5M | 3+ | External doctor |
| Cottage | $5M | Multi-year | External doctor |
| Alta Vista | $3.825M | Multi-year | Former employee |
| CVS | $18.2M | 6 | Employee |
| ReNew | $7.084M | 4 | External |

**Common Thread:** Successful whistleblowers are either **former employees** (already left) or **external parties** (physicians who observed from outside). Current employees risk severe retaliation.

**California False Claims Act Protections:**
- Reinstatement with seniority
- **2x back pay** with interest
- Compensation for special damages
- Punitive damages where appropriate
- Attorney's fees
- **Whistleblower reward:** 15-25% of recovery when government joins case

Despite legal protections, pattern shows protections insufficient to prevent career destruction.

#### 3.2.9 L.A. Care Systemic Failures

Under DHCS oversight, **L.A. Care Health Plan** (state's largest Medi-Cal plan) accumulated failures so severe it was **fined $55 million** for documented patient harm:

**Violations:**
- **41,500 instances** failing to timely issue grievance resolution letters (2019-2021)
- **92,854 instances** prior authorization requests not processed timely
- **Backlogs of 9,125+ authorization requests**

**Documented Patient Harm:**
- Cancer patients with deteriorating health experienced treatment delays
- One patient given 6-9 month prognosis **disenrolled from L.A. Care due to delays**

#### 3.2.10 Federal CMS Findings

**CMS Focused Program Integrity Review of California:**

**Key Findings:**
- **"CMS believes the number of investigations referred to DHCS is low for a Medicaid program"** of California's size
- **"The state does not track credible allegations of fraud based on referrals from MCOs"**
- **"The state does not review and approve the compliance plan or the fraud, waste, and abuse plan"** of Managed Care Organizations
- MCOs and DHCS reported **differing data** on investigations referred (state can't accurately track fraud referrals)

**OIG Recommendation:** DHCS should **"increase fraud referrals from managed care organizations"**

**This is the exact same oversight gap identified in Minnesota** where 80% of Medicaid payments flow through MCOs with minimal fraud oversight.

#### 3.2.11 Recovery Rates and Money Trail

**What California Recovered (FY 2024):**

| Source | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| CA MFCU Criminal Recoveries | $513M | **53% of national MFCU total** |
| CA MFCU (FY 2021-2023) | $544M | 180 indictments, 221 convictions |
| State AG Recoveries (July 2024-July 2025) | $134.25M | Led all states |
| Central District CA Federal (July 2024-July 2025) | $297.02M | Settlement recoveries |

**FY 2024 Highlights:**
- California MFCU alone recovered $513M - **more than 1/3 of entire national MFCU total**
- Made California "central driver" of FY2024 recovery growth
- **National MFCU ROI:** $3.46 recovered for every $1 spent

**What Was Actually Stolen (Known Cases):**

| Case | Amount | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Monte Vista Pharmacy (ONE pharmacy, ONE year) | $306M billed; $204M paid | Pending |
| Monte Vista co-conspirators (July 2025) | $269M billed; $178M paid | Pending |
| Shaklian/Alexsanian hospice | $54M billed; $23M paid | Pending trial |
| Santillan home health network | $60M | Pending |
| House of Angels hospice | $16M paid | $29.7M restitution ordered |
| Oscar Abrons prescription diversion | $20M | Pending |
| EDD Unemployment Fraud | **$20-32.6 BILLION** | Minimal recovery |

**Total documented in handful of major cases:** $600M+

**The Recovery Gap:**

California AG acknowledges:
> "Based on government and private studies, and on the hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud the Division of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse frequently recovers in a single year, **the amount stolen from Californians by Medi-Cal fraud could reach billions of dollars annually.**"

**The Math:**
- **Recovered FY 2024:** ~$944M (MFCU $513M + state AG $134M + federal CD-CA $297M)
- **Estimated Annual Fraud:** "Billions"
- **Recovery Rate:** Potentially <10%

**Money Trail Patterns:**

**Pattern 1 - Gold/Precious Metals:**
- Shaklian/Alexsanian: **$6M+ in gold bars and coins** purchased
- Gold: Portable, difficult to trace, retains value, sold internationally without traditional banking

**Pattern 2 - Overseas Transfers:**
- Foreign nationals flee before prosecution (Saint Gorge principal fled)
- Money flows to Armenia and other countries
- **Recovery rate for overseas transfers: <1%** (same as Minnesota's Kenya/Turkey/Somalia experience)

**Pattern 3 - Real Estate:**
- Fichidzhyan: Home purchased with fraud proceeds (forfeited) + two additional homes forfeited at sentencing
- Properties titled to shell companies or straw owners to obscure beneficial ownership

**Pattern 4 - Shell Companies:**
- Fichidzhyan: Dozen-plus shell companies to launder $5.3M+
- Multiple corporate entity layers obscure ownership
- Bank accounts in fake names (e.g., "Varsenic Babaian")

**Pattern 5 - Identity Fraud:**
- Foreign nationals' IDs used as straw owners
- **Deceased physicians' identities** for Medicare billing
- Synthetic identities for financial accounts

**What's Actually Recovered vs. Ordered:**

| Case | Restitution Ordered | Actually Seized | Recovery Rate |
|------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| House of Angels (Fichidzhyan) | $17,129,060 | $2,920,383 + 2 homes | ~17% |
| Shaklian/Alexsanian | TBD | $6M+ in gold | Unknown |
| Monte Vista | TBD | Unknown | Unknown |

**Harsh Reality:** Restitution orders often go uncollected. Defendants may be judgment-proof, funds already overseas, or assets hidden in shell companies/gold/other hard-to-trace forms.

#### 3.2.12 California OIG Findings on MFCU Deficiencies

**June 2025 HHS-OIG Inspection found CA MFCU had significant operational problems:**

- Claimed **$37,000 in unsupported costs**
- Claimed **$1.3M in unapproved costs**
- Made excess purchases
- Maintained outdated/inaccurate inventory
- Improperly claimed indirect costs
- Did not consistently report convictions to federal partners within required timeframes
- Experienced **challenges with staffing**
- Had issues with **"State Medicaid data that limited its ability to investigate and identify allegations of provider fraud"**

**The Missing Piece:** California's fraud detection is primarily **reactive** (whistleblowers), not proactive:
- Low MCO referral rates (CMS confirmed)
- Staffing challenges
- Data quality issues
- Most major cases from whistleblowers, not state systems

#### 3.2.13 California Summary

**Congressional Assessment:** Rep. Jason Smith (House Ways and Means Chairman, December 2025):
> "Medicare home health and hospice fraud directly undermines the safety and reliability of care for America's most vulnerable seniors. Auditors have reported an unprecedented jump in home health and hospice fraud in Los Angeles County, California—including one report showing 112 different hospices located at the same physical address. With $1.2 billion in improper payments in home health claims and the Inspector General reporting $198 million in suspected hospice fraud, **Gavin Newsom's California could just as well be another Minnesota.**"

**Primary Fraud Mechanisms:**
1. Hospice explosion (1,589% growth) driven by organized crime
2. Single pharmacy exploiting suspended safeguards ($204M in 10 months)
3. Political donations → no-bid contracts (587:1 ratio)
4. Armenian Organized Crime networks operating 100+ entities
5. Whistleblower-dependent detection (not proactive state systems)

**Primary Beneficiaries:**
1. Armenian Organized Crime networks
2. Healthcare companies receiving no-bid contracts
3. Politicians receiving donations ($10.6M → $6.3B contracts)
4. MCOs operating with minimal oversight

**Primary Failures:**
1. DHCS suspended prior authorization enabling $204M pharmacy theft
2. Political pay-to-play: $10.6M donations → $6.3B contracts
3. No proactive fraud detection; reliant on whistleblowers
4. MCO oversight inadequate (CMS confirmed low referral rates)
5. AG dismissed fraud as "contrived" rather than investigating

**Reforms Needed:**
1. Restore prior authorization immediately
2. Ban campaign donations from Medicaid contractors
3. Independent audit of MCO claims processing
4. Proactive fraud detection systems (not reactive whistleblower-dependent)
5. Eliminate behested payments loophole
6. Enforce hospice/home health moratoriums permanently until cleanup

UNIFIED MEDICAID FRAUD INVESTIGATION REPORT - PART 2
Continuation: Texas, New York, Illinois, Colorado, Florida + Comparative Analysis
Report Date: January 27, 2026
Classification: Investigative Analysis
Continuation of Part 1

3.3 TEXAS: 97% Through MCOs, 5-15% Recovery Rate
3.3.1 System Structure
Medicaid Overview:
    • Enrollment: 3.8 million beneficiaries 
    • Annual Budget: $41 billion (FY 2024-2025) 
    • Administration: Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) 
    • Model: Aggressive managed care; 97% of beneficiaries through MCOs (highest penetration nationally) 
    • Oversight: HHSC Office of Inspector General; Texas Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) 
Major MCOs (16 Total):
    • Centene/Superior HealthPlan: 1.24 million beneficiaries 
    • Amerigroup (Elevance): 965,000 beneficiaries 
    • UnitedHealthcare: Major presence 
    • Molina Healthcare: 268,000 beneficiaries 
    • Others: 12 additional MCOs 
Collective MCO Control: $35-40 billion annually in capitation payments
Recovery Audit Contractor: Health Management Systems (HMS)
3.3.2 The July 2025 CMS Audit - Systematic Failures Documented
CMS Focused Program Integrity Review (July 2025) examined 4 major MCOs and documented 8 significant observations about fraud detection failures:
Finding 1: No Proper SIU Staffing Ratios
    • No MCO maintained proper Special Investigative Unit staffing relative to member populations 
    • Fraud detection units understaffed 
    • Even obvious suspicious patterns went unexamined 
    • Example: Unit investigating fraud for 1 million beneficiaries had only handful of investigators 
Finding 2: State Law Conflicts with Federal Payment Suspension
    • Texas state law conflicts with federal payment suspension requirements 
    • Created situation where MCOs cannot properly suspend payments to fraudsters 
    • State's MFCU has not requested a single payment suspension since 2015 
    • This means for a decade, even when fraud identified, system had no mechanism to stop payments to confirmed fraudsters 
Finding 3: No Unannounced Site Visits
    • ALL FOUR major MCOs failed to conduct unannounced site visits to healthcare providers 
    • Unannounced visits are basic fraud detection tool 
    • Verify business exists, has claimed staff, actually delivers services 
    • Catches phantom clinics, clinics with no staff, hospices operating from apartments 
    • Texas MCOs were not doing this before pandemic and never did it 
Finding 4: No Beneficiary Service Verification
    • MCOs had no requirement to verify beneficiaries actually received billed services 
    • Healthcare system billing for services without confirming services delivered 
Finding 5: No MCO-to-MFCU Referral Tracking
    • HHSC-OIG does not track referrals from MCOs to Medicaid Fraud Control Unit 
    • State has no visibility into what fraud MCOs catch 
    • Cannot determine if MCOs catching fraud at all 
    • No data on whether fraud detection happening 
Result: CMS issued these as "observations" not formal findings of non-compliance. No enforcement action despite documented violations.
3.3.3 Recovery Rate Disaster
The Numbers That Reveal System Failure:
Wellpoint Texas:
    • Processes: $12.8 billion in medical claims annually 
    • Recovered: $426,467 
    • Recovery Rate: 0.003% 
To put in perspective: If someone stole $1 million, Wellpoint would recover $30.
Amerigroup:
    • Identified: $26.8 million in overpayments (3 years) 
    • Recovered: $5.5 million 
    • Recovery Rate: 20.5% 
    • Meaning: 79.5% of identified fraud never came back to state 
Superior HealthPlan:
    • Identified: $13.6 million in overpayments 
    • Recovered: $3.1 million 
    • Recovery Rate: 22.8% 
    • Meaning: 77.2% of identified fraud never recovered 
Parkland Community Health Plan:
    • Preliminary Investigations: 12 conducted 
    • Federal Requirement: Complete within 15 working days 
    • Times Deadline Met: 0 (zero) 
National Context: These recovery rates represent identified fraud only. For every dollar of fraud identified, four dollars remain undetected.
Overall Texas Recovery Rate: 5-15% of total fraud
    • For every $100 stolen: State recovers $5-15 
    • Remaining $85-95 stays with fraudsters 
Texas Medicaid Annual Fraud Estimate:
    • Annual Budget: $40-48 billion 
    • Fraud Rate (10% standard): $4+ billion annually 
    • MFCU Recovery FY 2023: $203 million 
    • MFCU Recovery FY 2022: $350 million 
    • Effective Recovery Rate: 5-15% 
3.3.4 Major Fraud Cases
THE MERIDA GROUP - HOSPICE AS PROFIT CENTER ($150M)
Principal: Rodney Mesquias Sentence: 20 years federal prison Restitution: $120 million Medical Director: Dr. Francisco Pena (also Mayor of Rio Bravo; convicted but died of COVID-19 before sentencing)
The Scheme:
Mesquias operated network of hospice companies exploiting fundamental vulnerability: once patients enrolled in hospice, minimal ongoing oversight.
Step 1 - Target Vulnerable Populations:
    • Patients from group homes 
    • Nursing facility residents 
    • Low-income housing residents 
    • Populations with limited self-advocacy ability 
    • Families with limited monitoring capacity 
    • Social isolation made them vulnerable 
Step 2 - False Terminal Certifications:
    • Falsely certified thousands of patients as terminally ill when they were not 
    • Enrolled in hospice (billed as end-of-life care) 
    • Patients didn't meet six-months-or-less criteria 
Step 3 - Keep Patients on Hospice for Years:
    • Continuously billed for services 
    • Patients remained alive and relatively stable 
    • Medicare/Medicaid paying for palliative care for patients who should have received curative treatment at fraction of cost 
Step 4 - No Ongoing Verification:
    • No regular verification patients meet terminal criteria 
    • No verification services being provided 
    • System assumes honesty; only investigates when someone complains 
Total Fraud: ~$150 million in fraudulent billings Actual Recovery: $120 million restitution ordered (actual recovery likely less)
4M PHARMACEUTICALS - PBM CORRUPTION ($160M)
Principal: Mohamad Mokbel (Houston) Structure: 14 pharmacies with straw owners International Component: Call center in Egypt
The Sophisticated Mechanism:
Step 1 - Straw Owner Structure:
    • 14 pharmacies across Texas 
    • Each had different straw owner 
    • Straw owner's name on Medicare enrollment 
    • Mokbel had no actual control visible in documents 
    • Created separation between Mokbel and operations (makes investigation harder) 
Step 2 - Purchase Beneficiary Data:
    • Bought Medicare beneficiary data on open market 
    • Price: $16-40 per person 
    • Lists included patient names and identifying information 
Step 3 - Generate Fraudulent Prescriptions:
    • Using purchased data, generated prescriptions supposedly written by legitimate physicians 
    • Physicians didn't actually write prescriptions 
    • Pharmacies filled prescriptions 
    • Billed Medicare 
Step 4 - International Coordination:
    • Call center in Egypt coordinated fraud network operations 
    • Managed prescription data flow 
    • Coordinated with straw owners 
    • Handled communications with pharmacies 
Step 5 - THE CRITICAL CORRUPTION - PBM Employee Bribed:
Mokbel paid $188,000 to OptumRx employee
Why This Mattered:
    • OptumRx processes pharmacy claims for insurance companies and Medicaid 
    • Employee didn't work for law enforcement or fraud investigation 
    • Worked for company processing pharmacy claims 
    • Role gave insider knowledge: 
        ◦ How OptumRx conducted audits 
        ◦ How it identified suspicious patterns 
        ◦ How it determined pharmacy account termination 
Three Categories of Assistance Provided:
    1. Improperly credentialed pharmacies (vouched for legitimacy when they were fraud fronts) 
    2. Gave advance information about what audits were looking for (allowed adjustment of billing patterns) 
    3. Provided guidance on how to respond to audits to prevent termination 
Total Fraud: ~$160 million
Significance: System relies on private companies (PBMs, MCOs, claims processors) to detect fraud. But these companies can be corrupted by individual actors with financial incentives. Single corrupt employee with inside knowledge can undermine entire payment system integrity.
NOURIAN COMPOUND CREAM - LARGEST DOJ ASSET FORFEITURE ($405M)
Principal: Dehshid Nourian Sentence: 17.5 years Restitution: $115 million Asset Forfeiture: $405 million (largest in DOJ healthcare fraud history)
The Scheme (Workers' Compensation System):
Step 1 - Identify Physicians:
    • Targeted physicians treating workers' comp patients 
    • Offered financial payments per prescription written 
Step 2 - Pay Kickbacks for Prescriptions:
    • Paid physicians per prescription for compound creams 
    • Compound creams = custom-formulated topical medications (expensive) 
    • Easy to bill without verification of necessity or provision 
Step 3 - Provide Formulations:
    • Gave physicians compound cream formulations to prescribe 
    • Physicians prescribed to patients 
    • Creams billed to insurance carrier or employer 
    • Medical necessity irrelevant 
    • Many prescribed to patients who didn't need them 
Step 4 - Systematic Profit:
    • Generated ~$52 million in fraudulent healthcare charges 
    • Nokbel kept proceeds 
The Asset Discovery (Search Warrant Execution):
When federal agents searched Nourian's residence and financial accounts:
    • $395 million in brokerage accounts 
    • Real estate in Dallas and Austin 
    • Shell company structures 
    • Family member accounts (money moved through financial system) 
Nourian hadn't just committed fraud - had systematically hidden proceeds through financial structures and asset purchases.
Government Obtained: $405 million asset forfeiture
Significance Beyond Dollar Amount: This isn't just billing for services not provided. This is corrupting medical decision-making process itself. When you pay doctor to prescribe something, you've compromised their judgment. They're no longer deciding medical necessity for patient. They're making decisions based on financial incentive.
REDDY INTERNATIONAL MONEY LAUNDERING - THE ONE SUCCESS ($41.2M RECOVERED)
Principal: Trivikram Reddy (nurse practitioner) Fraud Amount: $52 million defrauded from Medicare and private insurers Method: Billing for services not provided or not medically necessary
The International Transfer:
Rather than remain in U.S. facing prosecution, Reddy wired $55 million to bank accounts in India.
Not gradual flow through shell companies - direct transfer of assets to place beyond U.S. law enforcement reach.
The Exceptional Recovery:
Federal government, with Indian authority assistance, recovered $41.2 million from Indian accounts.
Why This Is Exceptional:
    • 75% recovery rate 
    • Required extensive bilateral cooperation 
    • Most international transfers never recovered 
    • This is NOT the norm 
What Remained Beyond Reach: $14 million
Historical Context: Most fraud cases never achieve international asset recovery because time-consuming, complicated, requires diplomatic cooperation. Vast majority of overseas money never recovered.
The Lesson: Modern criminals understand international finance. If they can move money to countries with less U.S. law enforcement cooperation, assets become difficult/impossible to recover. With normal recovery rates 5-15%, even large fraud amounts result in minimal consequences when money successfully moved overseas.
3.3.5 Political Protection: The Centene Model
CENTENE CORPORATION - DONATE, SETTLE, RENEW
Centene is one of nation's largest managed care companies. In 2021-2022, settling fraud cases across multiple states:
State	Settlement Amount	Year	Allegation
Tennessee	$18.7M	2021	Pharmacy overbilling
Arkansas	$15.2M	2021	Pharmacy overbilling
Texas	$165.6M	2022	Overcharging Medicaid pharmacy services
What Normal Person Would Expect: Company settling $165.6M fraud case would lose its contract with state.
What Actually Happened:
The Timeline:
    • July 2022: Centene's Superior HealthPlan settles $165.6M fraud case 
    • September 2022: (Two months later) State of Texas renews Superior HealthPlan's Medicaid contract to provide healthcare to foster children 
Why Would State Renew Contract With Company That Just Admitted Defrauding It of $165.6M?
Answer: Political Donations
Centene's National Strategy:
    • Donated $26.9 million to state politicians across 33 states since 2015 
    • Uses 300+ subsidiaries to multiply political donations 
    • Bypasses contribution limits by distributing through seemingly unrelated entities 
    • Texas: Company and executives made systematic contributions to key political figures 
March 2025 - The Surveillance Revelation:
Superior HealthPlan CEO Mark Sanders testified before Texas House of Representatives.
Under oath, Sanders admitted: Company hired private investigators to surveil legislators considering healthcare fraud oversight measures.
Not simply observing public activities. Gathered personal information including divorce records to gain leverage in political discussions.
Aftermath:
    • Sanders fired shortly after testimony 
    • Texas AG launched investigation 
    • But larger protection mechanism had already functioned: 
        ◦ Company operated for years with knowledge of fraud 
        ◦ Settled case with minimal consequence 
        ◦ Continued operating Medicaid contracts 
3.3.6 The 21CT Scandal - Friendship and No-Bid Contracts
Contract: Software system meant to detect Medicaid fraud Actual Result: Contract process itself became fraud case study
The Contract:
    • Started as no-bid 
    • Later expanded to $110 million 
    • Involved multiple government officials with personal/business relationships with contractor 
Key Figures:
Jack Stick - Deputy Inspector General (HHSC):
    • Before government position: Business partner with lobbyist for 21CT Health Commission 
    • Once in government: Sent emails promoting 21CT to other states 
    • Used personal email to obscure communications from official record 
    • Outcome: Resigned 
Stanley Stewart - Deputy Chief of Staff (HHSC):
    • Exchanged 150+ emails with 21CT CEO Irene Williams 
    • Acknowledged to state auditors his "influence" helped 21CT win contract 
    • Emails documented social meetings: coffees, lunches, dinners, viewing film "Bridesmaids" together 
    • Not professional contacts - personal relationships influencing $20M contract decision 
    • Outcome: Placed on administrative leave from $161K job 
Douglas Wilson - Inspector General (HHSC):
    • Attempted to raise concerns about 21CT contract 
    • Fired by Governor Rick Perry in December 2014 
The Federal Fraud:
    • To obtain $18 million in federal funding, state told CMS contract was "competitively bid" 
    • It was not - it was no-bid contract with predetermined winners based on personal relationships 
When Scandal Broke:
    • Jack Stick: Resigned 
    • Stanley Stewart: Administrative leave 
    • Erica Stick (Jack's wife, HHSC Chief of Staff): Paid administrative leave 
    • Charles Smith (HHSC Executive Commissioner overseeing contracting): Eventually retired 
21CT CEO Irene Williams:
    • Faced limited consequences despite her role 
    • Had donated $10,000 to Greg Abbott's campaign 
    • Abbott initially accepted donation 
    • Only after scandal broke: Abbott returned it 
Lesson: Political connections function as protection. Government officials prioritize personal relationships over competitive procurement. Contractors secure massive contracts without competing. When scandals emerge, officials resign/reassigned, but system continues.
3.3.7 Abbott's Donor-to-Appointee Pipeline
Governor Greg Abbott has raised $348 million over political career - highest amount raised by any Texas governor in state history.
Significant portion from healthcare industry figures with direct interests in Medicaid policy.
Texas Medical Board:
    • 15 of 22 Abbott appointees have made political donations 
    • These 15 donated average $43,000 each 
    • Seven board members alone: $393,103 collectively since 2014 
Example: Jack Dwyer (healthcare financier):
    • Donated: $500,000 
    • Appointment: 2024 Healthcare Workforce Task Force (state board making healthcare policy recommendations) 
The Structural Problem:
People making healthcare policy decisions have direct financial interests in healthcare industry outcomes. Board member who donated $50K to politician who appointed them has financial interest in decisions affecting healthcare companies depending on state contracts.
Not necessarily illegal corruption. Legal political donations. But creates structural situation:
    • Those making policy are those who already invested in politician making appointments 
    • Healthcare companies can effectively purchase influence over regulatory bodies supposed to oversee them 
3.3.8 Federal Oversight Failures
TEXAS STATE AUDITOR - PROCUREMENT DISASTER (July 2018)
Examined 28 procurements (competitive bidding for government contracts):
Result: Every single one contained evaluation errors. All 28.
Not minor technicalities:
    • Five procurements exceeded $3 billion in value each 
    • Contained "significant evaluation scoring errors and missing documentation" 
    • Prevented auditors from confirming whether state awarded contracts to best applicants 
Errors Across All 28:
    • Omitted scores 
    • Incorrect mathematical calculations 
    • Inappropriate application of evaluation criteria weights 
Translation: State's contracting process so broken it couldn't reliably determine whether awarding contracts to companies most deserving.
Contracts worth billions awarded based on flawed evaluation processes.
Charles Smith (HHSC Executive Commissioner): Retired May 2018 following scrutiny. Left with pension intact, no consequences.
System that failed to properly evaluate $4.6 billion in contracts continued under new leadership.
FEDERAL HHS-OIG AUDIT - $24 MILLION UNREPORTED (Oct 2016 - Sept 2018)
Examined whether Texas properly reporting and returning Medicaid overpayments for cases handled by MFCU.
Findings:
    • Out of 65 cases examined: Texas failed to correctly report overpayment amounts 
    • 26 cases: State simply did not report any overpayments even though $19 million identified as fraudulent 
    • 37 cases: Failed to report within federal timeframes 
    • Total unreported: $24.3 million in overpayments ($13.9M federal funds) 
Root Cause: Texas lacked written policies for recording MFCU overpayments and reconciling case files.
Translation: State had no documented procedures for how to handle fraud recoveries. Operating on informal practice, not systematized policy. Different offices handled same task differently. Some reported correctly, others didn't.
Not malicious wrongdoing - institutional incompetence. State had obligation to track/report fraud recovery; failed to implement basic administrative systems to do so.
CMS OBSERVATIONS - UNREMEDIED STRUCTURAL FAILURES (July 2025)
CMS Focused Program Integrity Review identified eight significant observations about MCO fraud detection failures.
Critical Point: Observations were not formally classified as findings of non-compliance (which would trigger required remediation).
They were observations - documented problems CMS noted but not followed by mandatory corrective action.
Creates strange situation: Federal oversight documents failures but doesn't compel resolution. Observations remain in record showing system broken, but no penalties or required changes follow.
3.3.9 International Money Trails
Documented International Flows:
India:
    • Reddy: $55M wired; $41.2M recovered (75% - exceptional) 
    • Required extensive bilateral cooperation 
    • Most cases never achieve this recovery 
Egypt:
    • Mokbel: Call center coordinating fraud operations 
    • Proceeds presumably to Egyptian accounts (amounts undocumented) 
Pakistan:
    • Billing and marketing companies coordinating operations 
    • Money flows undocumented 
Dubai, UAE:
    • Golf estate purchase 
    • Attempt to move fraud proceeds into real estate difficult to identify as crime proceeds 
Pattern Across Cases:
    • Fraudsters understand moving money overseas creates recovery problems 
    • Once outside U.S. banking system, trail becomes cold 
    • Countries with limited cooperation = permanent loss 
    • Even sophisticated cases (India recovery) required years and exceptional cooperation 
3.3.10 Texas Summary
Primary Mechanisms:
    1. MCO oversight collapse (97% through MCOs; CMS found systematic failures) 
    2. Hospice fraud ($150M+ in major cases) 
    3. Pharmacy fraud with PBM corruption ($160M) 
    4. Political donations → contract renewals despite fraud settlements 
    5. No-bid contracts based on personal relationships 
Primary Beneficiaries:
    1. Fraudsters (hospice operators, pharmacy networks) 
    2. MCOs (Centene renewed contract after $165.6M settlement) 
    3. Politicians receiving donations 
    4. Contractors with political connections (21CT) 
Primary Failures:
    1. CMS documented eight MCO oversight failures; no enforcement 
    2. Payment suspension system broken since 2015 
    3. Recovery rates 5-15% (85-95% of stolen money never recovered) 
    4. State auditor found all 28 major procurements had errors 
    5. HHS-OIG found $24M in fraud unreported 
    6. Political protection (donations → contract renewals) 
Reforms Needed:
    1. Enforce federal payment suspension requirements immediately 
    2. Mandate MCO staffing ratios for Special Investigative Units 
    3. Require unannounced site visits to all providers 
    4. Independent third-party audit of MCO claims (not self-audit) 
    5. Ban campaign donations from Medicaid contractors 
    6. Real enforcement when federal violations documented 

3.4 NEW YORK: $10.6 Billion Russian TCO and the Global Cap
3.4.1 System Structure
Medicaid Overview:
    • Enrollment: 7+ million beneficiaries 
    • Annual Budget: $90B+ (among largest state programs nationally) 
    • Administration: Three-agency structure: 
        ◦ New York Department of Health (DOH) 
        ◦ Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) - operates under Section 32 Public Health Law 
        ◦ Attorney General's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) 
    • Model: Comprehensive Managed Medicaid (MMC) 
    • Financial Control: "Global Cap" index 
The Global Cap System:
Fiscal Year	Global Cap Index	DOH Outside Cap	Local Growth Takeover	Home Care Min Wage	Total Global Cap
FY 2024	$23.3B	$5.0B	$1.8B	$0.9B	$28.3B
FY 2025	$24.8B	$6.8B	$2.0B	$1.5B	$31.6B
Managed Care Spending (Q2 SFY 2024-2025):
    • Total: ~$11.7 billion 
    • Mainstream Managed Care: ~50% 
    • Managed Long-Term Care (MLTC): ~50% 
MLTC is costliest population; enrollment projected +36,000 as of March 2025
Major MCOs: Multiple plans including UnitedHealthcare, various regional plans
3.4.2 Operation Gold Rush - $10.6 Billion Russian TCO
THE LARGEST INVESTIGATION
Amount: $10.6 billion in fraudulent Medicare and Medicaid claims billed Network: Russian-based transnational criminal organization Primary Mechanism: Durable Medical Equipment (DME) fraud Technology: Virtual Private Servers (VPS) to mask IP addresses and conceal true physical locations
The Sophisticated Infrastructure:
Step 1 - VPN/VPS Masking:
    • Used Virtual Private Servers to hide actual locations of conspirators 
    • Masked IP addresses 
    • Made investigation of true physical location extremely difficult 
Step 2 - Nominee Owners:
    • Many not lawfully present in United States 
    • Used to open financial accounts 
    • Names on official documents 
    • Actual fraudsters hidden behind nominees 
Step 3 - DME Billing:
    • Targeted Durable Medical Equipment reimbursements 
    • High-value items (wheelchairs, hospital beds, etc.) 
    • Billed for equipment never provided or not medically necessary 
Step 4 - Shell Companies:
    • Funnel stolen funds through shell companies 
    • Multiple layers of corporate entities 
Step 5 - International Money Laundering:
Destinations:
    • China 
    • Singapore 
    • Pakistan 
Step 6 - Cryptocurrency:
    • Used cryptocurrency for money laundering 
    • Growing trend in high-level healthcare fraud 
    • Difficult to trace 
    • Moves outside traditional banking systems 
Status: Ongoing prosecutions; multiple defendants
Significance: Demonstrates healthcare fraud has become core enterprise for transnational organized crime. Not isolated criminals - sophisticated international networks with technological infrastructure, money laundering capability, and operational security.
3.4.3 Transportation Fraud - The "Phantom Billing" Epidemic
UNIQUE CLASS LIMO, INC. - ORANGE COUNTY ($3.5M)
Principals: Rohail Raja and Sharma Alam Charge: Stealing over $3.5 million from New York State Department of Health Method: Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT) fraud
The Investigation Findings:
"Phantom Billing" - Trips That Never Happened:
    • Submitted false claims for transporting Medicaid recipients to medical providers 
    • Billed on dates when provider records showed no visits occurred 
    • No transportation needed because no medical appointment 
"Trip Splitting" - Billing Separately for Shared Rides:
    • Billed for separate trips for individuals actually transported together in single vehicle 
    • Example: Pick up Patient A and Patient B in same vehicle; bill two separate trips 
    • Doubles revenue for same service 
Bribery to Facilitate:
    • Allegedly bribed patients to cooperate with fraud 
    • Allegedly bribed drivers to submit false documentation 
Critical Vulnerability:
New York's verification of NEMT services is weak. System relies on provider self-reporting. No real-time GPS verification. No cross-check with medical provider appointment records. Allows providers to bill "ghost trips" and "deadhead miles" (trips without passengers) because state cannot see ride data in real-time.
Why This Matters:
NEMT fraud is widespread nationally. New York shares this vulnerability with other states (Florida, Texas, California). Because MCOs use third-party brokers for transportation, state has no direct visibility into actual ride data.
Pattern: Bill for trips that never happened. Bill multiple times for same trip. Bill for transporting people who never needed medical appointments.
3.4.4 Nursing Home Related-Party Fraud
New York MFCU has prioritized nursing home fraud. Pattern: "related-party transactions" where facility owners divert Medicaid funds meant for resident care into separate real estate or staffing companies they also own.
CENTERS FOR CARE - $45 MILLION SETTLEMENT
Amount: $45 million settlement Pattern: Funds diverted through related-party transactions Impact: Chronic understaffing; neglect
VAN DUYN NURSING HOME - $12 MILLION SETTLEMENT
Amount: $12 million settlement Pattern: Similar related-party diversion Impact: Chronic understaffing
The Mechanism:
    1. Nursing home receives Medicaid payments for resident care 
    2. Owner also owns separate real estate company 
    3. Owner also owns separate staffing company 
    4. Nursing home pays inflated rent to owner's real estate company 
    5. Nursing home pays inflated staffing fees to owner's staffing company 
    6. Money meant for resident care diverted to owner through these "related parties" 
    7. Result: Chronic understaffing; inadequate care; neglect 
Medicaid pays for care; owner siphons money; residents suffer.
3.4.5 MCO Oversight Failures
CMS FOCUSED PROGRAM INTEGRITY REVIEW FINDINGS (FY 2020-2022):
Critical Gap #1 - No MCO-to-MFCU Referral Protocol:
CMS identified major gap in interagency coordination: Lack of written agreement or established procedure for MFCU to receive fraud referrals directly from MCOs.
Federal requirement: MCOs must refer fraud to MFCU. New York had no formal process for this.
Critical Gap #2 - No Minimum SIU Staffing Ratios:
CMS encouraged New York to establish minimum staffing ratios for MCO Special Investigation Units (SIUs). Current resources may not be commensurate with size of managed care programs being managed.
Critical Gap #3 - "Black Box" Algorithms:
MCOs rely on "proprietary algorithms" for utilization management and fraud detection. Neither state nor public can verify:
    • Accuracy of care denials 
    • Effectiveness of fraud prevention 
    • Whether algorithms working as claimed 
Creates "black box" where oversight impossible.
3.4.6 State Blind Spots
SOCIAL ADULT DAY CARE (SADC) CENTERS - SCAM EPIDEMIC
What SADCs Are Supposed To Be: Facilities providing social and nutritional support to elderly enrollees
What Investigations Revealed:
New York Post and law enforcement investigations found many SADCs offer little to no medical or social support.
The Scam:
    • Operate as "scams" 
    • Recruit able-bodied individuals with cash bribes 
    • Individuals pretend to receive services 
    • Bill Medicaid through MLTC plans 
Why It Works:
    • SADCs bill Medicaid through MLTC plans 
    • State's oversight of MLTC plans deferred to MCOs themselves 
    • MCOs have weak incentives to detect fraud (see global section on MCO incentive problems) 
    • Program becomes target for large-scale fund siphoning 
THE "SELF-DISCLOSURE" LOOPHOLE
Providers and MCOs legally required to report and return overpayments within 60 days of identification.
OMIG Challenges:
    • Inconsistency in these reports 
    • Identification of capitation payments for incarcerated or deceased enrollees remains persistent issue 
    • OMIG planning expanded audits to recover millions in improperly paid premiums 
Translation: MCOs continuing to receive monthly capitation payments for:
    • People in prison (not receiving care) 
    • Dead people (definitely not receiving care) 
System failure so basic it reveals absence of real-time data verification.
3.4.7 Money Flow and Entity Analysis
CENTENE CORPORATION - SUBSIDIARY DONATION STRATEGY
Centene dominant player in New York MMC market. Company uses strategy of making campaign contributions through vast network of 300+ subsidiaries.
How It Works:
    1. Centene has 300+ subsidiaries 
    2. Makes donations through multiple seemingly unrelated corporate entities 
    3. Effectively bypasses individual and corporate contribution limits 
    4. Exerts significant influence over officials who oversee multi-billion-dollar contracts 
Lobbying Power (2024):
Organization	Amount Spent	Purpose
1199SEIU Healthcare Education Project	$11.5M	Leading spender on lobbying in NY
Alliance to Protect Home Care, Inc.	$10.6M	Critical budget appropriations and health policies
These organizations lobby on critical budget appropriations and health policies directly affecting flow of Medicaid dollars, particularly in high-growth:
    • Home care sector 
    • Long-term care sector 
3.4.8 New York Summary
Primary Mechanisms:
    1. Russian TCO: $10.6B DME fraud with VPN infrastructure, cryptocurrency laundering 
    2. NEMT "phantom billing" and trip splitting ($3.5M+ in single case) 
    3. Nursing home related-party transactions ($45M + $12M major settlements) 
    4. SADC centers operating as cash-bribe scams 
    5. Capitation for incarcerated/deceased enrollees 
Primary Beneficiaries:
    1. Russian transnational criminal organization 
    2. NEMT providers billing for ghost trips 
    3. Nursing home owners diverting funds through related parties 
    4. SADC operators recruiting individuals with bribes 
    5. MCOs receiving capitation for deceased/incarcerated 
Primary Failures:
    1. No formal MCO-to-MFCU referral protocol (CMS finding) 
    2. Understaffed MCO SIUs relative to member populations 
    3. Proprietary algorithms create "black box" (no transparency) 
    4. SADC oversight delegated to MCOs (weak incentives to detect) 
    5. Continued capitation for deceased/incarcerated (basic data failure) 
    6. NEMT verification inadequate (no real-time GPS/cross-checking) 
Reforms Needed:
    1. Mandatory written MCO-to-MFCU referral agreement with enforcement 
    2. Minimum SIU staffing ratios (proportional to membership) 
    3. Algorithm transparency requirements (public verification) 
    4. Independent SADC audits (not MCO self-policing) 
    5. Real-time enrollment verification (stop payments for deceased/incarcerated) 
    6. NEMT GPS verification and cross-check with medical appointments 

3.5 ILLINOIS: PBM Spread Pricing and the $16.3 Million Deceased Capitation Recovery
3.5.1 System Structure
Medicaid Overview:
    • Program: HealthChoice Illinois (HCI) 
    • Administration: Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) 
    • Model: Near-universal mandatory managed care including: 
        ◦ ACA expansion 
        ◦ Families/children 
        ◦ Managed Long Term Services and Supports (MLTSS) 
    • Characteristic: Highly centralized authority with aggressive post-payment enforcement 
Major MCOs:
MCO	Ownership/Affiliation
Aetna Better Health of Illinois	CVS subsidiary
Blue Cross Community Health Plans	Provider-aligned
CountyCare	Cook County-only
Meridian Health Plan	Centene subsidiary
Molina Healthcare	National MCO
Oversight:
    • HFS Office of Inspector General (OIG) 
        ◦ Bureau of Investigations 
        ◦ Bureau of Fraud Science & Technology 
    • Illinois Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) 
    • Medicaid Managed Care Oversight Commission (legislative body) 
The Commission Problem: Created to review everything from health outcomes to contract compliance. In 2024, work stymied by lack of in-person quorums. Led to:
    • Cancellation of multiple meetings 
    • Failure to issue formal recommendations to General Assembly 
    • Oversight mechanism became ineffective due to administrative inertia 
3.5.2 Major Fraud Cases
LATEENA SMITH - PSYCHOTHERAPY PHANTOM BILLING ($2.46M)
Principal: Lateena Smith (psychologist) Sentence: 3 years prison Amount Billed: $2.46 million for psychotherapy services never provided Amount Received: ~$1.5 million in restitution at sentencing
The Mechanism:
    • Used identities of Medicaid recipients 
    • Billed for thousands of psychotherapy sessions 
    • Sessions never actually provided 
    • Submitted claims using stolen beneficiary information 
Pattern: Solo provider exploiting weak service verification. System accepted claims without verifying sessions actually occurred.
MUHAMMAD BROTHERS - COVID-19 LAB FRAUD ($293M)
Principals: Minhaj and Sufyan Muhammad (brothers) Type: Criminal, multi-state Amount Billed: Over $293 million Amount Paid: At least $65 million before indictment Entities: Four clinical laboratories in Illinois and California
The Scheme:
    • Billed Medicare and Medicaid for COVID-19 laboratory testing services never provided 
    • Insurers paid at least $65M in reimbursements before indictment 
    • Multi-state operation (IL and CA) 
    • High-volume, multi-payer fraud 
    • Complexity: Exploited pandemic emergency response systems 
HOME CARE TIMESHEET FRAUD
Monique Sykes:
    • Submitted fraudulent timesheets 
    • Total: $4,710 
    • Pattern: Low-dollar, high-frequency abuse 
Cynthia Carter:
    • Billed over $10,000+ for services allegedly provided to client who was either: 
        ◦ Hospitalized (not home receiving care) 
        ◦ Already deceased 
Pattern: Widespread low-dollar, high-frequency abuse in home care sector. Each individual case small, but aggregate represents millions in fraud across thousands of providers.
3.5.3 The Deceased Capitation Discovery - $16.3 Million Recovery
MOST INNOVATIVE AND REVEALING INITIATIVE
HFS OIG Bureau of Fraud Science and Technology spearheaded analytic project into managed care capitation payments for deceased recipients.
What They Found: MCOs receiving monthly capitation payments for enrollees who had died.
FY 2025 Recovery: Over $16.3 million Expected Additional: Tens of millions more
Why This Matters:
The fact these payments were made in first place highlights systemic failure in real-time data reconciliation between:
    • HFS enrollment records 
    • MCO payment systems 
Translation:
    1. Person dies 
    2. Death not recorded in system (or recorded but not propagated to payment system) 
    3. MCO continues receiving monthly capitation payment for dead person 
    4. Dead person not receiving any healthcare 
    5. MCO keeps 100% of capitation as profit 
MCOs benefited from lagged data reconciliation. Every month delay in updating death records = another month of capitation payment for zero services.
How Long This Went Undetected:
Illinois OIG discovered this through data analytics project. Not from MCO self-reporting. MCOs had financial incentive to not identify these payments because they were pure profit.
Recovery of $16.3M in single fiscal year proves this was large-scale, systematic problem that had been occurring for years.
3.5.4 The PBM Spread Pricing Scandal
PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER OPACITY
Illinois Auditor General (2023) found:
    • Over $200 million in spread pricing overbilling to Medicaid over two years 
    • HFS did not have access to underlying contracts between MCOs and their PBM subcontractors 
    • State unable to verify if prices billed by PBMs matched reimbursements paid to pharmacies 
What Is "Spread Pricing"?
    1. PBM negotiates price with pharmacy (Example: $100 for prescription) 
    2. PBM bills MCO higher price (Example: $150 for same prescription) 
    3. PBM keeps "spread" ($50 difference) 
    4. MCO passes cost to state 
    5. State doesn't know actual pharmacy price because no access to contracts 
The Opacity Problem:
Because HFS lacked PBM-MCO contract access:
    • Could not verify actual drug costs 
    • Could not determine if PBMs overcharging 
    • Could not audit whether charges legitimate 
PBM-GPO STRUCTURES (Fee-Masking Vehicles):
GPO	Owner	Function
Zinc	CVS	Hide fees/rebates from plan sponsors
Ascent	Cigna	Obscure actual drug costs
Emisar	UnitedHealth	Inflate costs while appearing to provide "purchasing services"
These function as "mirages" that allow healthcare corporations to hide fees and rebates from plan sponsors, effectively inflating drug costs.
3.5.5 The Discovery Dispute - Long-Term Care Kickbacks
CASE: Stop Illinois Health Care Fraud, LLC v. Sayeed (False Claims Act)
Discovery During Long-Running Case:
What Was Revealed: Companies like Vital Homes and Physician Care paid for access to client data from nonprofit to bypass ordinary referral rotations.
The Scheme:
    1. Nonprofit maintains referral rotation list (ensures fair distribution of clients) 
    2. Companies pay nonprofit for access to client data 
    3. Companies use data to contact clients before rotation 
    4. Companies bypass fair referral system 
    5. Clear violation of Anti-Kickback Statute 
Detection Lag: Years
Why It Matters: This went undetected for years despite being clear kickback scheme. Shows how inadequate oversight allows even blatant violations to persist when actors understand system weaknesses.
3.5.6 Political Contributions and Influence
Healthcare Industry Contributions:
Four largest health insurers contributed significantly to Illinois campaigns. Recipients in Illinois among top ten nationally for insurer largesse.
Centene's Presence: Centene (operates Meridian Health Plan in IL) reached settlement with Illinois along with 12 other states over allegations of overbilling Medicaid pharmacy programs.
Multi-subsidiary donation strategy active in Illinois as in other states.
PBM GPO Influence:
Middlemen control significant portions of pharmaceutical spending. Their opacity allows them to influence policy while hiding true costs from oversight.
3.5.7 Illinois HFS OIG Achievements (FY 2025)
Despite Challenges, Strong Enforcement:
Metric	FY 2025	Change from Prior Year
Criminal Referrals to MFCU	82	+43%
Administrative Actions Filed	229	+50%
Payment Withholds Imposed	31	+121%
Total Collections	$51,915,061	Strong performance
Deceased Capitation Recovery: $16.3M alone proves value of data analytics approach.
3.5.8 Illinois Summary
Primary Mechanisms:
    1. PBM spread pricing ($200M+ over two years) 
    2. Deceased capitation payments ($16.3M recovered; ongoing) 
    3. Phantom service billing (psychotherapy, COVID labs, home care) 
    4. Long-term care kickbacks (referral rotation bypass) 
Primary Beneficiaries:
    1. PBMs (spread pricing profits; contract opacity) 
    2. MCOs (deceased capitation payments; indirect PBM benefits) 
    3. Fraudulent providers (phantom billing) 
    4. Companies paying kickbacks for referral access 
Primary Failures:
    1. PBM contract access denied to state (no audit capability) 
    2. Enrollment data not synchronized with death records (deceased capitation) 
    3. MCO Oversight Commission failed to meet (quorum issues; administrative inertia) 
    4. Service verification weak (allowed phantom billing) 
    5. Kickback schemes undetected for years 
Reforms Needed:
    1. PBM transparency legislation: Require full contract disclosure; ban spread pricing 
    2. Real-time enrollment automation: Death records immediately stop capitation 
    3. Commission governance reform: Ensure quorums; mandate in-person meetings 
    4. Service verification enhancement: Real-time confirmation of service delivery 
    5. Referral rotation monitoring: Prevent kickback schemes 
Illinois Demonstrates: Strong post-payment enforcement (HFS OIG recovered $51.9M) but preventative controls weak. Analytics found deceased capitation only after years of payments. System reactive, not proactive.

3.6 COLORADO: Risk Adjustment Fraud and the RAC Incentive Problem
3.6.1 System Structure
Medicaid Overview:
    • Program: Health First Colorado 
    • Administration: Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing (HCPF) 
    • Enrollment: ~1.7 million beneficiaries 
    • Provider Network: ~93,000 providers 
    • Model: Hybrid "Managed Fee-for-Service" under Accountable Care Collaborative (ACC) Phase II 
The ACC Structure:
    • Physical Health: Predominantly fee-for-service reimbursement 
    • Behavioral Health & Care Coordination: Managed by Regional Accountable Entities (RAEs) 
    • Unlike Full-Risk MCOs: RAEs manage care coordination but don't bear full financial risk for all services 
Regional Accountable Entities (RAEs):
RAE	Operator/Support	Affiliation
Northeast Health Partners	Beacon Health Options	Elevance subsidiary
Rocky Mountain Health Plan (RMHP)	RMHP	UnitedHealthcare company
Colorado Access	Nonprofit	Behavioral health focus
Denver Health Medical Plan (DHMP)	Provider-owned	Safety-net system
Oversight:
    • HCPF Audits & Compliance Division: 
        ◦ Program Integrity Section 
        ◦ Claims Investigation Unit 
    • Colorado Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) 
    • Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC): Health Management Systems, Inc. (HMS) 
RAC Program (SFY 2023): Recovered approximately $47 million in overpayments
3.6.2 Major Fraud Cases
PREMIER MEDICAL - GENETIC TESTING KICKBACKS ($27.5M)
Principal: Kevin S. Murdock (former CEO) Settlement: Over $27.5 million (multi-state) Type: Civil + Criminal, False Claims Act (qui tam) Whistleblower: Karen Mathewson (received percentage of recovery)
States Affected:
    • Colorado 
    • Georgia 
    • South Carolina 
    • Total Losses: Over $14 million to these three state Medicaid programs 
The Scheme:
    1. Illegal Kickbacks: Paid kickbacks to induce medically unnecessary cancer genetic testing 
    2. Target: Medicaid recipients recruited regardless of clinical criteria 
    3. No Medical Necessity: Tests performed whether medically indicated or not 
    4. Revenue Maximization: Volume over appropriate care 
Pattern: High-reimbursement niche (genetic testing) exploited through kickback payments. Solo provider could generate millions through inducements.
KAISER PERMANENTE - RISK ADJUSTMENT UPCODING ($581M)
Settlement: $581 million (nationwide; pending/announced) Entities: Kaiser Foundation Health Plan; Colorado Permanente Medical Group (CPMG) Type: Civil False Claims Act Scope: Multi-state
The Mechanism - Risk Score Inflation:
    1. Risk Adjustment Explained: Government pays higher capitation rates for sicker patients (incentivizes serving complex populations)
    2. The Fraud: Systematically over-reported severity of patient diagnoses to receive higher capitation
    3. "Upcoding": Coding patients as sicker than they actually were
    4. Internal Knowledge: Complaint alleged Kaiser identified categories of diagnosis codes with "extremely high error rates" as early as 2004
    5. Failure to Correct: Rather than fix errors, chose to retain inflated revenue
    6. Duration: 20+ years of systematic risk score inflation
Colorado Specific:
    • Colorado affiliate (CPMG) explicitly named 
    • Colorado Medicaid paid inflated capitation rates for years based on fraudulent diagnosis coding 
Significance: Risk adjustment fraud is structural vulnerability in capitated payment systems. Once MCO discovers diagnosis inflation increases revenue, strong financial incentive to continue (despite being fraud). Self-reporting unlikely.
3.6.3 The Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) Problem
THE PERVERSE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE
May 2024 Office of State Auditor Performance Evaluation revealed critical flaw:
How RAC Should Be Paid: Based on overpayments recovered (aligns contractor incentive with state interest)
How Colorado Actually Pays RAC: Based on overpayments identified/found (creates perverse incentives)
The Problem:
Fee Structure: Guaranteed at 18% of overpayments identified (not recovered)
Perverse Incentives Created:
    1. Contractor incentivized to inflate findings 
    2. Perform "overzealous audits" 
    3. Apply "inconsistent, unclear, or outdated policies" to maximize identified amounts 
    4. Many findings later rescinded upon appeal 
    5. But contractor already paid 18% 
Example:
    • RAC identifies $10M in "overpayments" (receives $1.8M) 
    • Providers appeal 
    • $6M reversed on appeal (findings were wrong) 
    • RAC keeps the $1.8M anyway 
Additional RAC Problems Found:
Contract Transmittals Used to Bypass Amendment Process:
    • HCPF used "contract transmittals" to modify RAC compensation 
    • Despite explicit contract language prohibiting such use 
    • Circumvented formal contract amendment procedures 
No Credential Verification:
    • Auditors found no evidence of required licenses or certifications for over 50% of RAC contractor's personnel 
    • Staff conducting medical audits may not have had required medical credentials 
The Gainwell-HMS Conflict:
2021: Gainwell Technologies (HCPF's primary Medicaid fiscal agent) acquired HMS (state's RAC)
Created Massive Conflict of Interest:
    • Entity responsible for state's claims processing system 
    • Now also controls primary mechanism for auditing that system's errors 
    • HCPF failed to obtain required conflict of interest disclosures following acquisition 
    • Program vulnerable to "self-audit" risks 
Translation: Company processing claims also auditing its own claim processing. Like asking bank to audit its own financial statements.
3.6.4 MCO/RAE Oversight Failures
CMS FOCUSED PROGRAM INTEGRITY REVIEW FINDINGS:
RAE Payment Suspension Non-Compliance:
    • MCO general contract required RAEs to suspend payments only at direction of HCPF 
    • This contradicts federal regulations requiring plans to suspend payments upon notice of "credible allegation of fraud" 
    • CMS found RAEs non-compliant with federal requirements 
Denver Health Medical Plan (DHMP) - Referral Failure:
    • DHMP was unaware of requirement to submit fraud referrals directly to MFCU 
    • Revealed significant breakdown in reporting chain 
    • MCO didn't know basic federal fraud referral requirements 
Physician-Owned MCO Conflicts:
    • Concerns regarding conflicts of interest in "physician-owned MCOs" receiving bonus payments from HCPF 
    • State lacks robust mechanism to ensure clinical decisions not influenced by profit-sharing arrangements 
"Little to No Financial Risk" for RAEs:
Because physical health services reimbursed via FFS:
    • RAEs bear "little to no financial risk" 
    • Fewer incentives to aggressively pursue provider overbilling in medical sector 
    • Only behavioral health and care coordination at financial risk 
    • 97% of medical spending has weak fraud detection incentives 
3.6.5 State and Federal Oversight Findings
STATE AUDITOR FINDINGS - MFANU (Aggregate Health First Colorado Savings):
Source	Amount
Aggregate Savings	$48,266,477
Provider Civil Settlements (MFANU)	$45,645,088
Member Fraud Recoveries	$330,821
Provider Criminal Restitution Identified	$139,298
Federal HHS-OIG Findings:
Not specifically detailed for Colorado in documents, but national pattern of inadequate state reporting applies.
3.6.6 Political Donations and Lobbying
UnitedHealth Group:
    • Parent company of Rocky Mountain Health Plan (RAE) 
    • Major donor to both state political parties 
    • Donations to individual candidates 
    • Maintains favorable relationship with policymakers determining capitated rates and quality bonus structures 
RAE executives receive appointments to health policy boards in Colorado (pattern consistent with other states)
3.6.7 Colorado Summary
Primary Mechanisms:
    1. Risk adjustment/upcoding (Kaiser $581M settlement) 
    2. Genetic testing kickbacks ($27.5M multi-state) 
    3. RAC abuse via identification-based compensation 
    4. Payment suspension non-compliance (RAE contracts illegal under federal law) 
Primary Beneficiaries:
    1. Kaiser Permanente (decades of inflated capitation from risk score fraud) 
    2. Premier Medical (genetic testing kickback scheme) 
    3. RAC contractor (paid for wrong findings; kept money after appeal reversals) 
    4. Gainwell/HMS (audit own systems; conflict of interest) 
Primary Failures:
    1. RAC paid for overpayments identified, not recovered (perverse incentive) 
    2. RAE contracts violated federal payment suspension rules 
    3. DHMP unaware of MFCU referral requirements (basic federal rule) 
    4. No credential verification for 50%+ of RAC staff 
    5. Gainwell-HMS conflict of interest (fiscal agent acquired auditor) 
    6. RAEs have little financial risk (weak fraud detection incentives) 
Reforms Needed:
    1. RAC compensation reform: Pay only for recovered overpayments (not identified) 
    2. True financial risk for RAEs: Align incentives with fraud detection 
    3. Mandatory fraud suspensions: Comply with federal law; no state approval required 
    4. Independent auditing firewalls: Separate fiscal agent from auditor 
    5. Credential verification: Ensure RAC staff actually qualified 
    6. Risk adjustment oversight: Independent audit of diagnosis coding accuracy 
Colorado Demonstrates: "Managed Fee-for-Service" model avoids some full-capitation pitfalls but creates system where private entities managing program (RAEs) lack financial incentive to police majority of medical spending. Combined with RAC program incentivizing inaccurate overpayment identification and lack of transparency regarding proprietary care algorithms, system remains highly susceptible to administrative waste and sophisticated provider fraud.

3.7 FLORIDA: The $14.6 Billion Takedown State
3.7.1 System Structure
Medicaid Overview:
    • Program: Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) 
    • Enrollment: 5+ million beneficiaries 
    • Annual Budget: $35B+ 
    • Administration: Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) 
    • Model: One of most aggressively privatized systems nationally 
Plan Types:
    • Managed Medical Assistance (MMA): Standard acute care 
    • Long-Term Care (LTC): Nursing facility and home-based care 
    • Dental: Specialized coverage 
As of 2025, Florida contracts with 16 MCOs including:
    • Humana 
    • UnitedHealthcare Community Plan 
    • Community Care Plan 
    • Centene subsidiaries 
    • Molina Healthcare 
    • Others 
Oversight:
    • AHCA Office of Inspector General: Internal Audit and Investigations 
    • Attorney General's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) 
        ◦ FY 2025 Funding: $30.5 million (75% federally funded) 
        ◦ Among most well-funded state MFCUs nationally 
    • Pharmaceutical & Therapeutics Committee: Manages Preferred Drug List (PDL) revised quarterly 
National ROI: MFCUs nationally recovered $3.46 for every $1 spent
3.7.2 The $14.6 Billion National Takedown (2025)
DOJ ANNOUNCEMENT (Southern District of Florida):
Charges: 37 defendants Total Alleged Fraud: Over $14.6 billion Location: Southern District of Florida Significance: One of largest healthcare fraud enforcement actions in U.S. history
This demonstrates Florida as frequent epicenter for national healthcare fraud "takedowns."
Example Case from Takedown:
NEWTECH MEDICAL SUPPLY
Principal: Eduardo Tieles Ruiz Entity: Newtech Medical Supply (clinic) Amount: Approximately $2.9 million in fraudulent claims Target: Medicare and Medicaid Type: Durable Medical Equipment (DME) fraud
The Scheme:
    • Submitted claims for DME never provided to patients 
    • Billed for wheelchairs, hospital beds, other equipment 
    • Patients never received equipment 
    • Medicare/Medicaid paid claims 
Pattern: Simple but effective. Bill for equipment never delivered. System pays automatically if claim formatted correctly. No verification equipment actually provided to patient.
3.7.3 Pharmaceutical Fraud - Gilead HIV Kickbacks
GILEAD SCIENCES SETTLEMENT - $3M+
Announced: Attorney General James Uthmeier Settlement Amount: Over $3 million to Florida Medicaid Type: Pharmaceutical kickback scheme
The Mechanism:
Gilead incentivized providers to prescribe high-cost brand-name HIV drugs:
    • Biktarvy 
    • Genvoya 
Inducements Provided:
    • Awards 
    • Meals 
    • Travel expenses 
The Effect:
    1. Providers prescribed high-cost drugs (influenced by kickbacks, not medical necessity) 
    2. Millions of dollars in false claims submitted to Medicaid 
    3. Patients potentially received more expensive drugs when cheaper alternatives available 
    4. Medicaid paid inflated costs 
Why This Matters:
Not just billing for services not provided. This is corrupting medical decision-making process. When pharmaceutical company pays provider to prescribe specific drug:
    • Provider no longer making decision based purely on patient's medical need 
    • Financial incentive influences clinical judgment 
    • Patients may receive more expensive (or less appropriate) medication 
    • System pays higher costs 
3.7.4 Behavioral Health Fraud - PSR Services
FLORIDA BEHAVIOR HEALTH, INC. - MIAMI ($1.2M)
Location: Miami Amount: Over $1.2 million billed to Medicaid Type: Psychosocial Rehabilitation (PSR) services fraud
The Scheme:
Step 1 - Recruit Patients with Illegal Kickbacks:
    • Paid patients (cash or other inducements) 
    • To attend PSR services 
Step 2 - Bill for Unnecessary Services:
    • PSR services not medically necessary for patients recruited 
    • Services designed for individuals with serious mental illness needing rehabilitation 
    • Recruited patients didn't meet criteria 
Step 3 - Submit False Claims:
    • Billed Medicaid for PSR sessions 
    • Represented services as medically necessary 
    • Received payments 
Pattern: Behavioral health fraud involves recruiting "patients" who don't need services, providing minimal or no actual treatment, billing for full services.
3.7.5 Physician Partners of America - Multi-Scheme ($24.5M)
PHYSICIAN PARTNERS OF AMERICA (PPA) - TAMPA
Settlement: $24.5 million Location: Tampa Type: Whistleblower allegations (False Claims Act)
The Dual Scheme:
Part 1 - Unnecessary Medical Testing:
    • Billed for unnecessary medical testing 
    • Tests not medically indicated 
    • Patients didn't need tests performed 
    • Submitted false claims representing medical necessity 
Part 2 - False SBA Loan Statements:
    • Made false statements to obtain Small Business Administration (SBA) loans 
    • Misrepresented financial condition or business operations 
    • Obtained loans based on fraudulent information 
Combined Settlement: $24.5M resolves both Medicare/Medicaid fraud AND SBA loan fraud
3.7.6 MCO Oversight Failures
CMS FOCUSED PROGRAM INTEGRITY REVIEW (2025) FINDINGS:
Critical Failure #1 - Inadequate Interagency Coordination:
Florida's Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with MFCU did not adequately outline procedures for MCOs to refer potential fraud directly to law enforcement.
This violates federal regulation 42 CFR § 455.21(c)(3)(iv)
Critical Failure #2 - No Beneficiary Verification Reporting:
AHCA does not require MCOs to regularly report results of their "beneficiary verification of services."
What This Means:
    • MCOs contractually required to verify services billed were actually received 
    • State lacks mechanism to track "return on investment" 
    • State cannot determine effectiveness of verification efforts 
    • No data on whether MCOs actually performing verifications 
Critical Failure #3 - Outdated MFCU Agreement:
State's agreement with MFCU not revised in over five years (non-compliant with federal standards)
Critical Failure #4 - Physician-Owned MCO Conflicts:
CMS observations suggested need for stronger safeguards against conflicts of interest in physician-owned MCOs where:
    • Physicians provide care 
    • Physicians share in insurer profits 
    • Medical necessity decisions may be compromised to protect MCO bottom line 
Translation: Doctor decides if patient needs expensive procedure. Doctor also gets share of MCO profits (which are higher if fewer expensive procedures approved). Structural conflict.
3.7.7 NEMT Fraud - The Ghost Trip Problem
Non-Emergency Medical Transportation represents significant loophole in Florida (same as New York, Texas, California).
The Pattern:
    • "Ghost trips" - billing for trips that never happened 
    • "Deadhead miles" - trips without passengers 
    • Trip splitting - billing separately for shared rides 
Why It Works:
MCOs subcontract NEMT services to secondary vendors. Oversight trail becomes fragmented. State cannot verify service delivery in real-time.
No Real-Time Verification:
    • No GPS verification requirement 
    • No cross-check with medical appointment records 
    • Relies on provider self-reporting 
    • Easy to bill for services never delivered 
3.7.8 Political Influence and Money Flow
THE FLORIDA REPUBLICAN PARTY CONNECTION
Major insurers like Humana and UnitedHealth Group have consistently favored Florida Republican Party (which oversees state's Medicaid policy).
Humana:
    • Directed 44% of its state-level political giving to Florida 
    • Florida Republican Party = largest single recipient nationally 
Four Largest Health Insurers Study Period:
    • Recipients in Florida received over $1.1 million 
    • Represented 19% of national giving 
Centene Corporation:
    • Heavy presence in Florida 
    • Employs same "subsidiary donation" strategy (300+ subsidiaries) 
    • Maximizes political footprint 
    • Capital flow often followed by favorable contract awards and legislative changes supporting managed care expansion 
3.7.9 Recovery Data
PROJECTED FLORIDA MFCU PERFORMANCE:
Metric	Amount	Notes
Total State/Federal MFCU Funding	$30,510,157	FY 2025
Projected ROI (National Avg)	$3.46 per $1.00	Expected return
Gilead HIV Settlement Recovery	$3,033,238	Single case
Physician Partners Settlement	$24,500,000	Single case
National Average: MFCUs recover $3.46 for every dollar spent (Florida well-funded, likely performs at/above average)
But: Even with strong MFCU, structural oversight of 16 MCOs managing program plagued by:
    • Outdated interagency agreements 
    • Lack of granular reporting on service verification 
    • Physician-owned MCO conflicts 
    • NEMT fragmented oversight 
3.7.10 Florida Summary
Primary Mechanisms:
    1. Multi-billion dollar fraud schemes (2025 takedown: $14.6B total alleged) 
    2. DME phantom billing (Newtech: $2.9M example) 
    3. Pharmaceutical kickbacks (Gilead: $3M+ settlement) 
    4. Behavioral health recruitment fraud (Florida Behavior Health: $1.2M) 
    5. Unnecessary medical testing + false loan statements (PPA: $24.5M) 
    6. NEMT ghost trips (pattern consistent with NY, TX, CA) 
Primary Beneficiaries:
    1. Sophisticated criminal networks (multi-billion schemes) 
    2. DME suppliers billing for non-existent equipment 
    3. Pharmaceutical companies (kickback schemes) 
    4. Behavioral health providers recruiting with inducements 
    5. Physician groups billing unnecessary tests 
    6. NEMT providers billing ghost trips 
Primary Failures:
    1. MCO-to-MFCU referral procedures inadequate (federal violation) 
    2. No requirement for MCOs to report beneficiary verification results 
    3. MFCU MOU not updated 5+ years (federal non-compliance) 
    4. Physician-owned MCO conflicts inadequately addressed 
    5. NEMT oversight fragmented (subcontractor opacity) 
Reforms Needed:
    1. Update MFCU MOU immediately: Comply with federal standards; establish clear MCO referral procedures 
    2. Mandate beneficiary verification reporting: Track MCO verification efforts; measure effectiveness; enforce compliance 
    3. Address physician-owned MCO conflicts: Ban profit-sharing OR create strict firewalls between clinical decisions and financial interests 
    4. NEMT real-time verification: GPS tracking; cross-check with medical appointments; eliminate ghost trip capability 
    5. Strengthen pharmaceutical kickback enforcement: Aggressive prosecution; enhanced monitoring of manufacturer-provider relationships 
Florida Demonstrates: Well-funded, highly effective MFCU conducting multi-agency takedowns and pharmaceutical settlements. But structural oversight of 16 MCOs managing program plagued by outdated agreements and lack of verification reporting. Strong back-end enforcement, weak front-end prevention. Continued political influence of major insurers remains central challenge to ensuring SMMC dollars used effectively for patient care.

4. CROSS-STATE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
4.1 Identical Fraud Schemes Replicated Across States
The evidence demonstrates these are not isolated state failures but systematic replication of identical fraud schemes exploiting identical vulnerabilities.
Hospice Fraud Explosion
State	Growth Pattern	Scale	Organized Crime
California	1,589% growth (115→1,841 hospices)	112 hospices at ONE address	Armenian Organized Crime networks; 100+ entities
Texas	Significant operations	Merida Group: $150M fraud	Multiple networks; false terminal diagnoses
Florida	Major component of $14.6B takedown	Undocumented but significant	Part of national enforcement actions
New York	Part of nursing home/long-term care fraud	Related-party transactions $45M+$12M settlements	Connections to broader schemes
Common Characteristics:
    • False terminal certifications 
    • Patients kept on hospice for years 
    • Vulnerable population targeting (group homes, nursing facilities, low-income housing) 
    • Minimal ongoing verification once enrolled 
    • "Churn and burn" method (close when audited, reopen under new name) 
Pharmacy Fraud
State	Major Case	Amount	Method
California	Monte Vista Pharmacy	$204M (10 months)	Prior authorization suspension exploitation
Texas	4M Pharmaceuticals	$160M	PBM employee bribed; Egypt call center
Illinois	PBM Spread Pricing	$200M+ (2 years)	Contract opacity; state no access
New York	Operation Gold Rush component	Part of $10.6B	International criminal organization
Common Characteristics:
    • High-cost drugs targeted 
    • Straw owner structures 
    • Minimal verification of dispensing 
    • International coordination (Egypt, China, Pakistan) 
    • PBM corruption or opacity 
Transportation Fraud (NEMT)
State	Documentation	Pattern
New York	Unique Class Limo: $3.5M	Ghost trips, trip splitting, patient/driver bribes
Texas	CMS findings	Fragmented oversight; broker opacity
Florida	Pattern identified	Same fragmented oversight issue
Common Characteristics:
    • "Ghost trips" - billing for trips never occurred 
    • "Deadhead miles" - trips without passengers 
    • Trip splitting - billing separately for shared rides 
    • No real-time GPS verification 
    • Subcontractor opacity 
    • No cross-check with medical appointment records 
Risk Adjustment / Upcoding
State	Case	Amount	Duration
Colorado	Kaiser Permanente	$581M settlement	20+ years (since 2004)
Florida	Pattern identified	Undocumented	Multi-year
New York	Suspected in MCO operations	Undocumented	Ongoing
Common Characteristics:
    • Systematic over-reporting of diagnosis severity 
    • Internal knowledge of error rates 
    • Failure to correct despite knowledge 
    • Decades of operation before detection 
    • Self-reporting unlikely (financially incentivized to continue) 
Autism/EIDBI Services
State	Case	Amount
Minnesota	Asha Hassan	$14M
Other States	Similar patterns identified	Various
Common Characteristics:
    • Billing for therapy never provided 
    • Forged credentials 
    • Falsified service records 
    • Weak verification of actual service delivery 
4.2 Identical MCO Oversight Failures
CMS Focused Program Integrity Reviews identified IDENTICAL failures across multiple states:
No Unannounced Site Visits
State	Finding	Impact
Texas	ALL 4 major MCOs failed to conduct	Basic fraud detection tool unused
California	Limited and ineffective	112 hospices at one address undetected
New York	Not conducted systematically	SADC scams operated freely
This basic fraud detection tool - sending someone to verify business actually exists and operates as claimed - was NOT being used across all three states.
No MCO-to-MFCU Referral Protocols
State	CMS Finding	Violation
New York	No written agreement or procedure	42 CFR § 455.21(c)(3)(iv)
California	Low referral rates; state doesn't track	Same regulation
Texas	HHSC-OIG doesn't track MCO referrals	Same regulation
Federal regulation REQUIRES states to have established procedures for MCOs to refer fraud to MFCU. Three states documented as non-compliant. CMS issued "observations" but NO ENFORCEMENT.
Payment Suspension Violations
State	Finding	Violation
Texas	State law conflicts; no suspensions since 2015	42 CFR § 455.21
Colorado	RAE contracts required state approval (illegal)	Same regulation
Florida	MFCU agreement outdated; no procedures	Same regulation
Federal regulation REQUIRES payment suspension upon credible fraud allegation. Three states violating. No enforcement action.
Inadequate SIU Staffing
State	Finding
Texas	No proper staffing ratios; understaffed
New York	CMS encouraged minimum staffing ratios
California	Inadequate for program size
Across states, MCO Special Investigative Units understaffed relative to member populations. Even obvious fraud patterns go unexamined.
No Beneficiary Service Verification
State	Finding
Texas	No requirement to verify beneficiaries received services
California	DHCS doesn't require MCO reporting of verification results
Healthcare systems billing for services without confirming services actually delivered.
4.3 Identical Political Dynamics
Campaign Donations Preceding Favorable Treatment
State	Example	Pattern
Minnesota	Farah donated $10K+ to AG Ellison 9 days after Dec 11 meeting	Donation → protection attempt
California	$10.6M donations → $6.3B contracts (587:1 ratio)	Donation → contract award
Texas	Centene $165.6M fraud settlement → contract renewed	Donation → contract despite fraud
Colorado	UnitedHealth donations → favorable rates/bonuses	Donation → policy influence
Illinois	Four largest insurers among top contributors	Donation → influence
New York	Centene 300+ subsidiary strategy	Donation → bypass limits
Florida	Humana 44% of giving to FL; FL GOP largest recipient	Donation → favorable policy
The pattern is consistent: Campaign donations correlate with favorable contract treatment, renewal despite fraud settlements, appointment to oversight boards, and policy decisions benefiting donors.
Revolving Door
All states document pattern of:
    • Government officials overseeing MCOs later working for MCOs 
    • MCO employees becoming government officials 
    • Personal relationships spanning both sectors 
    • "21CT scandal" (Texas) exemplifies: business partner became deputy IG 
MCO Executives on Health Policy Boards
State	Pattern
California	Healthcare industry figures appointed to boards by Newsom
Texas	Abbott appointees to Medical Board; 15 of 22 donated (avg $43K)
Colorado	RAE executives receive policy board appointments
All States	People making policy have financial interests in outcomes
Whistleblower Retaliation
State	Documentation
Minnesota	480+ documented retaliation cases
California	Pattern: Successful whistleblowers are former employees (already left) or external
All States	Current employees risk career destruction despite legal protections
Dismissal of Fraud Concerns as Politically Motivated
State	Example	Quote
Minnesota	Racism accusations used to suppress Feeding Our Future investigation	"Cultural sensitivity" cited
California	AG Bonta dismissed fraud as political	"The whole idea...is contrived. It's manufactured."
Pattern: Rather than investigate fraud allegations, officials deflect criticism as racist/political/manufactured.
4.4 Identical International Money Flows
Money Laundering Destinations
Destination	States	Purpose
China	Minnesota ($1.1M+), New York (Operation Gold Rush)	Banking non-cooperation; permanent loss
Somalia	Minnesota ($1M+; Treasury terror investigation)	Al-Shabaab concerns; no recovery framework
Kenya	Minnesota ($3M+; extradition pending)	Limited cooperation; partial recovery possible
Armenia	California (networks; amounts undocumented)	Organized crime headquarters; limited cooperation
India	Texas ($55M → $41.2M recovered = 75%)	EXCEPTIONAL cooperation case; not typical
Egypt	Texas (call center operations)	International coordination; no recovery
Pakistan	Texas, New York (billing/marketing companies)	Limited cooperation
Dubai/UAE	Texas (golf estate); multi-state	Real estate purchases; difficult to prove fraud proceeds
Maldives	Minnesota ($500K+)	Banking secrecy; no cooperation
Turkey	Minnesota (amounts sealed)	Investigation ongoing
Singapore	New York (Operation Gold Rush)	International criminal organization destination
Pattern: Fraudsters understand moving money overseas creates recovery problems. Historical recovery rate <1% for international transfers.
Money Laundering Methods
All States Show:
    • Shell companies (multiple layers obscure beneficial ownership) 
    • Real estate purchases (titled to straw owners) 
    • Gold/precious metals (CA: $6M+ in one case; portable, untraceable) 
    • Cryptocurrency (NY Operation Gold Rush; growing trend) 
    • Straw owners/nominee structures 
    • Deceased physician identities (CA) 
    • Synthetic identities (CA: "Varsenic Babaian") 
4.5 Recovery Rate Comparison
State	Estimated Fraud	Documented Recovery	Recovery Rate	Notes
Minnesota	$9-28B	<$70M	<1%	Massive MCO blindspot
California	$6-12B/year	$944M/year	~10%	Whistleblower-dependent
Texas	$4B/year	$203-350M/year	5-15%	CMS documented failures
Colorado	$2-4B	$48M (SFY 2023)	~2%	RAC perverse incentives
Illinois	$2-5B	$51.9M (FY 2025)	~2%	Strong post-payment enforcement
New York	$5-10B	Unknown	Unknown	$10.6B single case (Operation Gold Rush)
Florida	$4-8B	Unknown	Unknown	$14.6B single takedown (2025)
National Pattern: 5-15% recovery rate. 85-95% of stolen money never recovered.
Why Recovery Fails:
    1. Domestic: Shell companies, real estate, gold, cryptocurrency, time delay 
    2. International: Countries don't cooperate; money permanently lost 
    3. System Design: Detection takes months/years; fraudsters move money immediately 
4.6 COVID-19 Waiver Abuse - Universal Pattern
All States Suspended Safeguards During Pandemic:
State	Suspended Safeguard	Exploitation	Current Status (Jan 2026)
California	Prior authorization (180 days)	Monte Vista: $204M in 10 months	Partially restored
Texas	Telemedicine restrictions	1,714 high-risk providers; $127.7M fraud; payments 25x pre-COVID	Not fully restored
Minnesota	DHS waivers	Enabled fraud continuation	Partially restored
All States	Site visits, documentation, credentialing	Widespread exploitation	Gradual resumption; incomplete
Pattern: Emergency waivers became permanent vulnerabilities. Suspensions enabled massive fraud. Safeguards not fully restored years after emergency ended.
4.7 Organized Crime Penetration - Multi-State Networks
Armenian Organized Crime
Primary Base: Los Angeles County, California Operations: Healthcare fraud (hospice, home health, DME), cargo theft, bank fraud, wire fraud, extortion Scale:
    • 2010: $163M scheme, 73 defendants, 118 clinics across 25 states 
    • 2025: 100+ LA County hospices likely network-operated 
    • May 2025: 5 hospices dismantled 
Why Healthcare Fraud Attractive:
    • Billions available through government payments 
    • Low detection risk 
    • Lenient sentences vs. violent crime 
    • Automatic payments if claims formatted correctly 
Somali Networks
Primary Base: Minnesota Major Operation: Feeding Our Future ($250-350M) International Scope: Somalia, Kenya, Turkey, Maldives Political Component: Donations to MN Democratic officials Terror Investigation: Treasury investigating Al-Shabaab links
Russian Transnational Criminal Organizations
Primary Base: Multi-state Major Operation: Operation Gold Rush ($10.6B claims) Technology: VPN infrastructure, cryptocurrency International Scope: China, Singapore, Pakistan Method: DME fraud, nominee owners throughout U.S.
Pharmaceutical Networks
Multi-State Operations:
    • 4M Pharmaceuticals (TX): $160M, Egypt call center, PBM corruption 
    • Similar patterns in IL, NY, CA Characteristics: International coordination, straw structures, data purchasing 
4.8 Structural Vulnerabilities - The Common DNA
Every state investigation revealed IDENTICAL structural vulnerabilities:
The MCO Audit Blindspot
State	% Through MCOs	Annual Amount	Independent Audit
Minnesota	80%	$8.0B	NO (Optum excludes MCOs)
Texas	97%	$39.8B	NO (CMS found failures)
California	80%+	$100B+	NO (DHCS oversight inadequate)
New York	80%+	$72B+	NO (no MCO internal operations audit)
Illinois	Near-universal	$28B+	NO (no PBM contract access)
Colorado	Hybrid (RAEs)	$8B+	NO (RAE fraud detection minimal)
Florida	97%	$34B+	NO (MCO self-audit only)
Total National: $290B+ annually flows through MCOs with minimal independent fraud oversight.
The System Design:
    1. State pays MCOs fixed monthly capitation 
    2. MCOs process claims internally 
    3. MCOs audit themselves 
    4. State has no independent verification 
    5. Fraudsters exploit both channels (direct + MCO) simultaneously 
The Provider Enrollment Gateway
All States:
    • Straw owner structures conceal beneficial ownership 
    • Deceased physicians' identities used for billing 
    • Foreign nationals as nominee owners 
    • Minimal verification of credentials or capacity 
    • No unannounced site visits during enrollment 
    • No cross-check with law enforcement investigation lists 
Example: California had 112 hospices at one address
The Payment Suspension Failure
Multiple States Violating Federal Law:
    • Texas: No suspensions since 2015 (state law conflicts) 
    • Colorado: RAE contracts required state approval (illegal under federal law) 
    • Florida: MFCU agreement outdated; no procedures 
Federal regulation 42 CFR § 455.21 REQUIRES payment suspension upon credible fraud allegation. States violating. CMS issues observations. NO ENFORCEMENT.
The Political Protection Mechanism
Universal Pattern:
    1. Companies donate to politicians (directly or through subsidiaries) 
    2. Politicians appoint donors to oversight boards 
    3. Politicians award contracts to donors (sometimes no-bid) 
    4. Companies settle fraud cases 
    5. Politicians renew contracts despite fraud 
    6. Officials receiving donations don't recuse from related decisions 
Examples:
    • TX: Centene $165.6M settlement → contract renewed 
    • CA: $10.6M donations → $6.3B contracts 
    • MN: Farah $10K+ donation → AG meeting 
    • All: MCO executives on health policy boards 

5. FINANCIAL FLOW & ENTITY MAPPING
5.1 The Major Players - National MCO Companies
Centene Corporation
Presence Across All Seven States

    • September 2022: Contract renewed (2 months later) 
    • March 2025: CEO admits hiring private investigators to surveil legislators 
    • March 2025: CEO fired; TX AG investigation launched 
The Pattern:
    1. Operate in state 
    2. Donate to politicians 
    3. Settle fraud case 
    4. Continue operations; contract renewed 
    5. Surveillance of oversight legislators

Presence Across All Seven States
Subsidiaries:
    • UnitedHealthcare (multiple states) 
    • Optum State Government Solutions (Minnesota auditor) 
    • Rocky Mountain Health Plan (Colorado RAE) 
    • Various others 
The Minnesota Conflict:
    • UnitedHealthcare operated as Minnesota MCO until December 31, 2024 
    • Governor Walz hired Optum (UnitedHealth subsidiary) as auditor 
    • Audit explicitly excluded MCO claims (80% of Medicaid) 
    • Company hired itself to audit system including its own subsidiary 
    • UnitedHealthcare exited Minnesota December 31, 2024 (weeks after MCO blindspot revelation) 
Separate DOJ Investigation:
    • May-July 2025: DOJ announced investigation into UnitedHealth for Medicare fraud 
    • Timing suggests broader enforcement scrutiny 
Political Donations:
    • Major donor to both state parties in multiple states 
    • Maintains relationships with policymakers determining capitated rates and bonuses 
Blue Shield of California
16-Year Relationship with Governor Newsom:
Year	Donation	Purpose	What Followed
2005	$25,000	SF Mayor project	Established relationship
2002-2018	~$23M	Campaigns/causes	Political ascent
2019	$100,000	Inaugural fund	Administration access
Jan 2020	$20 million	Homelessness fund	See below
2020	$300,000	Future of Work nonprofit	Policy influence
2020	$15 million	Vaccine distribution	No-bid contract
December 2022 Backroom Deal:
    • Competitive bidding reversed 
    • Blue Shield given San Diego County 
    • Health Net (Centene) kept LA County despite being "lowest performers" 
Kaiser Permanente
Multi-State Risk Adjustment Fraud:
Settlement: $581 million (nationwide) States: Colorado explicitly named; likely others Scheme: Risk score inflation since 2004 (20+ years) Method: Systematic over-reporting of diagnosis severity Internal Knowledge: "Extremely high error rates" known since 2004 Action: Chose to retain inflated revenue rather than correct
California Presence:
    • Donated $35,910 to campaigns 
    • Received $172,217,805 in state payments 
    • Ratio: 4,795:1 
Molina Healthcare

    • Anthem Blue Cross (California) 
    • Northeast Health Partners via Beacon (Colorado) 
California:
    • Donated $69,305 
    • Received $844,875,535 
    • Ratio: 12,191:1 
5.2 Shell Company Structures
Identified Across All States:
Minnesota - Feeding Our Future:
    • 250+ shell nonprofits 
    • Forged 501(c)(3) documentation 
    • Fake board members 
    • No legitimate operations 
California - Armenian Networks:
    • House of Angels: Dozen shell companies (Fichidzhyan laundered $5.3M+) 
    • Shaklian: Synthetic identity "Varsenic Babaian"; 7 healthcare entities 
    • Foreign nationals as straw owners 
Texas:
    • 4M Pharmaceuticals: 14 pharmacies with different straw owners 
    • Nourian: Shell structures holding $395M in brokerage accounts 
New York:
    • Operation Gold Rush: Multiple shell companies 
    • Nominee owners not lawfully present in U.S. 
Pattern Across All States:
    1. Create shell entity (company/nonprofit) 
    2. Use straw owner (name on documents; doesn't control) 
    3. Open bank accounts in shell/straw owner name 
    4. Bill Medicare/Medicaid 
    5. Funds to shell accounts 
    6. Transfer through multiple layers 
    7. Final destination: Overseas, real estate, gold, cryptocurrency 
5.3 Pass-Through Entities and Related-Party Transactions
New York Nursing Homes:
Centers for Care ($45M):
    • Nursing home receives Medicaid for resident care 
    • Owner also owns real estate company 
    • Owner also owns staffing company 
    • Nursing home pays inflated rent to owner's real estate company 
    • Nursing home pays inflated staffing fees to owner's staffing company 
    • Money meant for residents diverted to owner 
    • Result: Chronic understaffing, neglect 
Van Duyn ($12M):
    • Same pattern 
    • Related-party transactions 
    • Funds diverted 
    • Residents suffer 
Pattern: Owner creates multiple entities. Medicaid money flows to primary entity, then to related entities owner controls. Money laundering through legal business structure.
5.4 PBM-GPO Fee-Masking Vehicles
Illinois Discovery:
    • $200M+ in spread pricing over 2 years 
    • State lacks access to MCO-PBM contracts 
    • Cannot verify actual drug costs 
National PBM-GPO Structures:
GPO	Owner	Function
Zinc	CVS	Fee masking
Ascent	Cigna	Fee masking
Emisar	UnitedHealth	Fee masking
The Mechanism:
    1. PBM negotiates price with pharmacy ($100) 
    2. PBM bills MCO higher price ($150) 
    3. PBM keeps "spread" ($50) 
    4. MCO passes cost to state 
    5. State can't see actual pharmacy price (no contract access) 
    6. GPO provides "purchasing services" (obscures fees/rebates) 
Result: Healthcare corporations hide fees and rebates from plan sponsors, inflating drug costs while appearing to provide legitimate services.
5.5 Suspicious Vendor Relationships
California - State Vendors:
Open the Books Investigation:
    • 979 vendors donated $10.6M to Newsom 
    • Same vendors received $6.2B in state payments 
    • Ratio: 587:1 
No-Bid Contracts:
Vendor	Donation	Contract	Value
BYD (China)	$40,000	Masks	$990M + $316M extension
UnitedHealth	$189,000	Testing + data	$177M + $315M
Blue Shield	$23M over time	Vaccine	$15M
Texas - 21CT Scandal:
$110 Million Contract:
    • Started no-bid 
    • Jack Stick (Deputy IG): Former business partner with 21CT lobbyist 
    • Stanley Stewart (Deputy Chief): 150+ emails with CEO; "influence" admitted 
    • Social meetings: coffees, lunches, dinners, "Bridesmaids" movie 
    • Personal relationships = $20M contract 
CEO Irene Williams:
    • Donated $10,000 to Abbott 
    • Abbott returned only after scandal broke 
5.6 Political Donations and Lobbying
Summary of Major Healthcare Company Political Giving:
California:
Company	Donations	State Payments	Ratio
Anthem Blue Cross	$69,305	$844,875,535	12,191:1
Centene/Health Net	$242,550	$206,155,778	850:1
Kaiser Permanente	$35,910	$172,217,805	4,795:1
Blue Shield	$102,550 + $20M behested	$74,283,100	Complex
UnitedHealth	$130,000 + $100K inaugural	$315M+	1,369:1
Texas:
    • Governor Abbott raised $348 million (highest in TX history) 
    • Significant portion from healthcare industry 
    • 15 of 22 Medical Board appointees donated (avg $43K each) 
    • Jack Dwyer: $500K → Healthcare Workforce Task Force appointment 
New York Lobbying (2024):
    • 1199SEIU Healthcare: $11.5M (leading spender) 
    • Alliance to Protect Home Care: $10.6M 
Illinois:
    • Four largest insurers among top contributors 
    • Recipients in IL among top ten nationally 
Florida:
    • Humana: 44% of state-level giving to FL 
    • FL Republican Party: Largest single recipient 
    • Four largest insurers: $1.1M to FL recipients (19% of national) 
Pattern Universal:
    • Healthcare industry = major political donor in all states 
    • Donations correlate with contract awards 
    • Appointees to oversight boards are donors 
    • "Behested payments" bypass contribution limits (CA: $227M in 2020) 
5.7 Multi-State Financial Flow Example - Centene
Centene's Multi-State Operation:
    1. Operate in 33+ states under 300+ subsidiary names 
    2. Donate through subsidiaries (bypass contribution limits) 
    3. Total donations: $26.9M nationally (since 2015) 
    4. Receive state contracts (worth billions collectively) 
    5. Commit fraud (pharmacy overbilling documented in multiple states) 
    6. Settle fraud cases (IL $56.7M, AR $15.2M, TX $165.6M) 
    7. Reserve $1B+ for future settlements (Bloomberg Law, 2021) 
    8. Continue operating (contracts renewed despite fraud) 
    9. Surveil legislators (TX: Private investigators admitted March 2025) 
    10. Face minimal consequences (CEO fired; company continues) 
Total State Payments to Centene Nationally: Billions annually
Total Fraud Settlements: $1B+ (acknowledged; reserved for more)
Recovery Rate: Settlements minor percentage of revenue
Contracts: Renewed despite fraud
Political Influence: Maintained through donations

6. SYSTEMIC ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
6.1 The Fundamental Incentive Misalignment
The Core Problem:
Managed Care Organizations are asked to:
    1. Provide healthcare to beneficiaries 
    2. Detect and prevent fraud within their networks 
    3. Maximize profitability for shareholders 
These goals are incompatible when fraud-inflated spending justifies higher capitation rates.
The Financial Incentive Structure:
Scenario A - MCO Aggressively Detects Fraud:
    • Invests in sophisticated fraud detection systems ($$$) 
    • Hires large Special Investigative Units ($$$) 
    • Conducts frequent unannounced site visits ($$$) 
    • Result: Lower medical spending detected 
    • Effect on Capitation Rate: State sees lower spending; reduces future capitation 
    • Effect on MCO: Higher costs (detection), lower revenue (reduced capitation) 
    • Shareholder Response: Negative; profits reduced 
Scenario B - MCO Tolerates Fraud:
    • Minimal investment in fraud detection (saves $$$) 
    • Small/understaffed SIU (saves $$$) 
    • Rare site visits (saves $$$) 
    • Result: Higher medical spending (fraud included) 
    • Effect on Capitation Rate: State sees higher spending; historical data justifies higher future capitation 
    • Effect on MCO: Lower costs (minimal detection), higher revenue (inflated capitation) 
    • Shareholder Response: Positive; profits increased 
Rational Economic Behavior: MCO will choose Scenario B.
This is not corruption. This is predictable response to incentive structure.
6.2 The "Black Box" Problem - Proprietary Algorithms
Multiple States Identified:
MCOs use "proprietary algorithms" for:
    • Utilization management 
    • Fraud detection 
    • Care authorization decisions 
The Opacity:
    • Algorithms are trade secrets 
    • State cannot examine 
    • Public cannot verify 
    • No independent validation 
Creates "Black Box" Where:
    • Care denials cannot be verified as appropriate 
    • Fraud detection effectiveness cannot be measured 
    • System could be designed to minimize fraud detection 
    • No accountability 
New York CMS Finding Explicit: "Proprietary algorithms" create situation where neither state nor public can verify accuracy of care denials or effectiveness of fraud prevention.
6.3 The Audit Gap - By Design, Not Accident
Minnesota Most Documented Example:
Decision Chain:
    1. Governor Walz needs Medicaid audit 
    2. Hires Optum (UnitedHealth subsidiary) 
    3. UnitedHealthcare is active Minnesota MCO 
    4. Contract explicitly excludes MCO claims 
    5. Result: 80% of Medicaid spending unaudited 
Why This Occurred:
Official Justification: "Complexity" and "different regulatory framework"
Actual Reasons:
    1. Optum financial interest: As MCO subsidiary, interest in not auditing MCO spending (including parent company's) 
    2. Political relationships: MCOs lobby effectively; broader audit creates pressure 
    3. System complexity: Yes, MCO systems complex - but that's precisely why they need auditing 
    4. Cost concerns: Full audit more expensive (but cost of NOT auditing = $5-10B in fraud) 
This is not accident. This is design choice that predictably enables fraud.
Replication Across States:
State	% Through MCOs	Independent Audit
Minnesota	80%	NO
Texas	97%	NO
California	80%+	NO
New York	80%+	NO
Illinois	Near-universal	NO
Colorado	Hybrid	NO
Florida	97%	NO
$290B+ annually unaudited nationally.
This is not isolated state failure. This is nationwide system design that predictably enables fraud.
6.4 The Payment Suspension Failure - Federal Law Unenforced
Federal Regulation: 42 CFR § 455.21 requires payment suspension upon "credible allegation of fraud"
States Documented as Non-Compliant:
    • Texas: State law conflicts; no suspensions since 2015 
    • Colorado: RAE contracts required state approval (illegal) 
    • Florida: MFCU agreement outdated; no procedures 
CMS Response: Issues "observations" not "findings" Enforcement Action: NONE Penalties: NONE Required Corrective Action: NONE
Result: Federal law violated for decade+ in multiple states. No consequences.
Why It Matters:
Once fraud identified, continuing to pay fraudster:
    1. Enables continued fraud 
    2. Allows fraudster to move more money 
    3. Reduces recovery likelihood 
    4. Signals lack of enforcement 
Texas Example: MFCU hasn't requested single payment suspension since 2015. For ten years, when fraud identified, system had no mechanism to stop payments.
6.5 The Provider Enrollment Vulnerability
Across All States:
Current System:
    • Provider submits enrollment application 
    • Lists "owner of record" 
    • State accepts at face value 
    • No verification of beneficial ownership 
    • No unannounced site visit during enrollment 
    • No verification of capacity (facilities, staff, equipment) 
    • No cross-check with law enforcement investigation lists 
Result:
Straw Owner Structures:
    • 112 hospices at one address (California) 
    • 14 pharmacies with different straw owners (Texas 4M Pharma) 
    • 250+ shell nonprofits (Minnesota FOF) 
    • Deceased physicians used for billing (California) 
    • Foreign nationals as nominee owners (multiple states) 
Why Straw Owners Work:
    1. Fraudster identifies willing nominee 
    2. Nominee's name on enrollment documents 
    3. System verifies nominee identity (real person) 
    4. System doesn't verify nominee actually controls business 
    5. Enrollment approved 
    6. Fraudster operates; nominee provides separation 
    7. When caught, nominee faces prosecution; fraudster has plausible deniability 
The Fix is Simple:
    • Verify beneficial ownership, not just nominee 
    • Unannounced site visit within 30 days of enrollment 
    • Verify facilities exist and have capacity claimed 
    • Cross-check owner against law enforcement databases 
This fix is not implemented because it would slow enrollment.
Trade-Off: Faster enrollment vs. fraud prevention. States chose faster enrollment. Predictable result: Massive fraud.
6.6 The COVID-19 Waiver Problem - Temporary Became Permanent
All States Suspended Safeguards During Pandemic:
Justification: Emergency response; need speed over verification
What Was Suspended:
    • Prior authorization requirements 
    • Telemedicine restrictions 
    • Documentation requirements 
    • Site visit requirements 
    • Provider credentialing standards 
Examples:
California Prior Authorization:
    • January 1, 2022: Medi-Cal Rx goes live 
    • DHCS suspends prior authorization for 180 days 
    • Result: Monte Vista Pharmacy steals $204M in 10 months 
    • Single pharmacy billing "tens of millions per month" should trigger alarms 
    • No alarms triggered; payments continued 10 months 
Texas Telemedicine:
Period	Monthly Payments	vs. Pre-COVID
Pre-COVID	$800,000	Baseline
April 2020	$43,000,000	5,375% increase
2023 Average	$20,000,000	2,500% increase
    • HHS-OIG identified 1,714 high-risk providers billing $127.7M fraudulently 
    • Despite this, elevated payment levels continue 
    • Safeguards not restored 
The Pattern:
    1. Pandemic emergency → suspend safeguards 
    2. Fraud exploits suspended safeguards 
    3. Emergency ends 
    4. Safeguards remain suspended (years later) 
    5. Fraud continues 
Why Safeguards Not Restored:
    • Administrative inertia: Easier to maintain status quo than reinstate 
    • Industry lobbying: Providers/MCOs benefit from reduced oversight 
    • Political calculation: Reinstating safeguards = acknowledging earlier suspension enabled fraud 
    • Systems not built to easily toggle: Suspension easier than reinstatement 
This is not oversight. This is policy choice to prioritize convenience over fraud prevention.
6.7 The Political Protection Mechanism
The System:
    1. Companies Donate:
        ◦ Directly to politicians 
        ◦ Through 300+ subsidiaries (Centene model) 
        ◦ Via "behested payments" (CA: no limits) 
        ◦ To state parties 
    2. Politicians Appoint Donors to Oversight Boards:
        ◦ TX: 15 of 22 Medical Board appointees donated (avg $43K) 
        ◦ CA: Healthcare industry figures appointed to policy boards 
        ◦ CO: RAE executives receive appointments 
        ◦ Pattern universal 
    3. Politicians Award Contracts:
        ◦ Sometimes no-bid (CA Blue Shield: $15M vaccine; UnitedHealth: $177M + $315M) 
        ◦ Sometimes competitive bidding reversed (CA Dec 2022 backroom deal) 
        ◦ Often to donors (CA: $10.6M donations → $6.3B contracts = 587:1) 
    4. Companies Commit Fraud:
        ◦ Centene: IL $56.7M, AR $15.2M, TX $165.6M settlements 
        ◦ Kaiser: $581M risk adjustment fraud 
        ◦ Blue Plus (MN): $13M+ fines 
        ◦ Pattern across all states 
    5. Companies Settle Fraud Cases:
        ◦ Settlements typically <10% of revenue generated from fraud 
        ◦ Restitution orders often uncollected 
        ◦ No admission of wrongdoing (civil settlements) 
    6. Politicians Renew Contracts:
        ◦ TX: Centene $165.6M settlement (July 2022) → contract renewed (Sept 2022) 
        ◦ MN: Blue Plus $13M+ fines → still operating, processing $2.33B annually 
        ◦ Pattern: Fraud settlement doesn't end relationship 
    7. Oversight Weakened:
        ◦ Officials receiving donations don't recuse 
        ◦ Investigations suppressed (MN: "cultural sensitivity"; CA: AG dismisses as "contrived") 
        ◦ Whistleblowers retaliated (MN: 480+ documented) 
        ◦ Enforcement minimal 
This Creates Closed Loop:
    • Money (public Medicaid funds) → Companies → Fraud proceeds 
    • Fraud proceeds → Political donations 
    • Political donations → Contract awards 
    • Contract awards → More public Medicaid funds 
    • Fraud becomes cost of doing business; penalties minor; political protection ensures continuation 
This is not isolated corruption. This is systemic protection mechanism replicated across all seven states.
6.8 The Recovery Failure - 85-95% Permanently Lost
Why Recovery Fails:
Domestic Challenges:
    1. Shell Companies: Multiple layers obscure ownership
        ◦ Fichidzhyan (CA): Dozen shell companies 
        ◦ Nourian (TX): Shell structures holding $395M 
        ◦ Proving fraud proceeds difficult through layers 
    2. Real Estate: Property titled to straw owners
        ◦ Proving purchase with fraud proceeds requires extensive investigation 
        ◦ Fraudster can claim legitimate source 
        ◦ Seizure process slow 
    3. Gold/Precious Metals:
        ◦ Shaklian (CA): $6M+ in gold bars/coins 
        ◦ Portable, untraceable, retains value 
        ◦ Can be sold internationally without banking records 
    4. Cryptocurrency:
        ◦ NY Operation Gold Rush used cryptocurrency 
        ◦ Blockchain analysis possible but difficult 
        ◦ Most trails go cold 
        ◦ International exchanges don't cooperate 
    5. Time Delay:
        ◦ Fraud detection takes months/years 
        ◦ Fraudsters move money immediately 
        ◦ By time recovery attempted, money long gone 
International Impossibility:
Destination	Cooperation	Recovery Rate	Example
China	None	0%	MN: $1.1M → 0%
Somalia	None	0%	MN: $1M → 0%
Maldives	None	0%	MN: $500K → 0%
Armenia	Limited	~0%	CA: Networks operate freely
Kenya	Limited	Variable	MN: $3M → Extradition pending 18+ months
India	Exceptional	75%	TX: $55M → $41.2M recovered
Egypt	Limited	Unknown	TX: Call centers
Pakistan	Limited	Unknown	Multiple states
Dubai/UAE	Limited	Unknown	TX: Real estate
India Exception Proves Rule:
Texas Reddy case recovered 75% ($41.2M of $55M transferred). This required:
    • Extensive bilateral cooperation 
    • Years of effort 
    • Significant diplomatic capital 
    • This is NOT typical 
Historical Rate: <1% of international transfers ever recovered
The Math:
If 10% of fraud goes overseas (conservative):
    • $5B fraud estimate nationally 
    • $500M overseas 
    • <1% recovered = $5M 
    • $495M permanently lost 
Combined with domestic recovery failures:
    • Total fraud: $50-82B (estimated 5-year) 
    • Total recovered: $5-8B 
    • Missing: $42-74B 
Recovery rate 5-15% not accident. Not insufficient effort. Structural inevitability given:
    1. International transfers unrecoverable 
    2. Domestic laundering through shells/gold/crypto difficult 
    3. Time delay between fraud and detection 
    4. Restitution orders often uncollected (judgment-proof defendants) 
6.9 The Whistleblower Dependency - System Failure Indicator
Pattern Across States:
Most major fraud recoveries from whistleblowers, not state detection:
California Examples:
Case	Settlement	Whistleblower	Years	Status
Gold Coast	$70.7M	2 former employees	7	Had to leave jobs
CenCal	$95.5M	External doctor	3+	Not employee
Cottage	$5M	External doctor	Multi-year	Not employee
Alta Vista	$3.825M	Former employee	Multi-year	Already left
CVS	$18.2M	Employee	6	Risk taken
ReNew	$7.084M	External	4	Not employee
Total: ~$200M from handful of whistleblower cases
Minnesota:
    • Gold Coast = largest Medi-Cal fraud settlement 
    • Whistleblower-driven, not state-discovered 
Pattern:
    • Successful whistleblowers are former employees (already left) or external parties 
    • Current employees risk career destruction 
    • Despite legal protections, retaliation common 
    • MN: 480+ documented retaliation cases 
What This Reveals:
If official fraud detection systems working:
    • State would detect fraud proactively 
    • MCO referrals would be primary source 
    • State analytics would identify patterns 
Reality:
    • Whistleblowers detect fraud 
    • Years to resolve (averaging 4-7 years) 
    • Whistleblowers must leave jobs or be external 
    • State depends on individuals willing to sacrifice careers 
This is not minor implementation problem. This is system design failure.
System relies on:
    • Individual courage 
    • Personal financial sacrifice 
    • Years of legal process 
    • Career destruction risk 
Rather than:
    • Proactive state detection 
    • MCO referrals as required by federal law 
    • Real-time data analytics 
    • Automated anomaly detection 
The dependency on whistleblowers proves official systems not working.
6.10 The Federal Oversight Failure - CMS Issues Observations, Not Enforcement
CMS Documented Identical Failures Across States:
Violations Identified:
    • No MCO-to-MFCU referral protocols (NY, CA, TX) 
    • No unannounced site visits (TX all 4 MCOs; CA limited; NY inadequate) 
    • Payment suspension violations (TX since 2015; CO contracts illegal; FL outdated) 
    • Inadequate SIU staffing (TX, NY, CA) 
    • No beneficiary service verification (TX, CA) 
CMS Response:
    • Issues "observations" (not "findings of non-compliance") 
    • No enforcement action 
    • No penalties 
    • No required corrective action 
    • No deadlines for remediation 
    • Violations persist for years 
Why This Matters:
Federal oversight agency:
    1. Conducts reviews 
    2. Documents violations of federal regulations 
    3. Takes no enforcement action 
    4. Violations continue 
This is not oversight failure. This is choice not to enforce.
Possible Explanations:
    1. Political Pressure: MCO industry lobbies heavily at federal level 
    2. State Resistance: States resist federal intervention in Medicaid administration 
    3. Resource Constraints: CMS lacks enforcement capacity 
    4. Regulatory Capture: MCO industry influence over regulatory process 
    5. Systemic Tolerance: Fraud accepted as inevitable cost 
Result: Federal regulations exist. States violate. No consequences. System continues.
Example - Payment Suspension:
42 CFR § 455.21 requires payment suspension upon credible fraud allegation.
Texas: No suspensions since 2015 (10 years of violations) CMS: Issues observation Enforcement: None Texas: Continues not suspending
Regulation effectively meaningless if not enforced.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.1 Immediate Actions (0-90 Days)
These actions can be implemented immediately without legislative changes and would produce measurable fraud reduction within first year.
1. Enforce Federal Payment Suspension Requirements
Action: Immediate federal enforcement of 42 CFR § 455.21

    • 30-day deadline for compliance 
    • Financial penalties for continued non-compliance 
    • Automatic payment suspension upon credible fraud allegation 
    • No state approval required (illegal under federal law) 
Expected Impact: Immediate reduction in fraud continuation; fraudsters unable to continue receiving payments while under investigation
2. Mandate MCO-to-MFCU Referral Reporting
Action: CMS requires monthly fraud referral reporting
    • Every MCO must report fraud referrals to MFCU monthly 
    • Format: Number of referrals, amounts, case types, outcomes 
    • Public dashboard showing state-by-state MCO referral rates 
    • Penalties for MCOs failing to refer or under-reporting 
Expected Impact: Transparency into which MCOs detecting fraud; public pressure on low-performing MCOs; increased referrals
3. Emergency Restoration of COVID-Suspended Safeguards
Action: All states reinstate pre-pandemic verification requirements
    • Prior authorization restored (CA immediate implementation)

Expected Impact: $100M+ nationally in immediate recovery; ongoing prevention of future improper payments
7.2 Short-Term Reforms (90 Days - 1 Year)
These actions require regulatory changes or moderate implementation periods.
5. Independent MCO Claims Audits
Action: Every state contracts independent third-party auditor for MCO claims
    • Scope: 100% of MCO claims processing (not self-audit)

Expected Impact: Detection of $5-10B in MCO fraud annually; deterrent effect on future fraud
6. Mandatory MCO SIU Staffing Ratios
Action: Federal regulation establishing minimum SIU staffing
    • Ratio: 1 SIU investigator per 10,000 members 
    • Qualifications: Required licenses, fraud investigation training

These actions require legislative changes, system development, or multi-year implementation.
9. Ban Political Donations from Medicaid Contractors
Action: Federal and state legislation prohibiting donations
    • Complete ban on campaign donations from any entity receiving Medicaid payments 
    • Includes subsidiaries (closes Centene 300-subsidiary loophole) 
    • Ban "behested payments" (closes CA loophole) 
    • Mandatory recusal for officials receiving donations before ban 
    • Violations: Contract termination + debarment 
Expected Impact: Elimination of pay-to-play; contract awards based on merit; increased oversight willingness
10. Provider Beneficial Ownership Verification

    • Disclosure: All individuals with 10%+ ownership stake 
    • Verification: Cross-check against corporate records, property records 
    • Unannounced visit: Within 30 days of enrollment 
    • Cross-check: Against law enforcement investigation databases 
    • Straw owners: Prosecution of both nominee and actual controller 
Expected Impact: Elimination of straw owner structures; reduction in organized crime penetration
11. Algorithm Transparency Requirements
Action: Federal regulation requiring MCO algorithm disclosure
    • Public description of utilization management algorithms 
    • Independent validation of fraud detection algorithms 
    • Annual audit by state of algorithm effectiveness 
    • Prohibition on "black box" systems without state verification 
    • Alternative: State-designed algorithms MCOs must use 
Expected Impact: Accountability for care denials; verification of fraud detection effectiveness; reduced "black box" opacity
12. PBM Contract Transparency and Spread Pricing Ban
Action: Federal legislation requiring full PBM contract disclosure
    • States must have access to ALL MCO-PBM contracts 
    • Public disclosure of drug acquisition costs 
    • Ban on "spread pricing" 
    • Require pass-through pricing (state pays actual cost + fixed admin fee) 
    • Prohibition on PBM-GPO fee-masking vehicles 
Expected Impact: $1-2B savings nationally from spread pricing elimination; transparency enables cost verification
7.4 Long-Term Systemic Changes (2-5 Years)
These actions require fundamental system redesign.
13. Realign MCO Incentives - Fraud Detection Performance Metrics
Action: Capitation rates adjusted based on fraud detection performance
    • Metric: Fraud detection rate (amount detected / total claims) 
    • Metric: Referral rate to MFCU 
    • Metric: Recovery rate from detected fraud 
    • Metric: Unannounced site visit completion 
    • Metric: Beneficiary verification completion 
    • Formula: High-performing MCOs receive bonus; low-performing receive reduction

    • Employment protection: Mandatory reinstatement with damages 
Expected Impact: Increased whistleblower reporting; reduced retaliation; earlier fraud detection
15. International Asset Recovery Framework
Action: Expanded Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties and enforcement
    • Expand MLATs with high-risk destinations (China, Somalia, Armenia, Pakistan, UAE) 
    • Treasury FinCEN: Geographic targeting orders for Medicaid-related transfers >$3,000 
    • Automatic asset freezes: For individuals under fraud investigation 
    • Cryptocurrency tracing: State-level capability development 
    • Diplomatic pressure: Make healthcare fraud recovery priority in bilateral discussions 
Expected Impact: Increased international recovery from current <1% to 5-10%; deterrent effect on overseas transfers
16. RAC and Audit Contractor Reform
Action: Restructure Recovery Audit Contractor compensation
    • Pay based on recovered amounts, not identified 
    • Eliminate guaranteed percentages 
    • Performance bonuses for high accuracy (low appeal reversal rates) 
    • Penalties for excessive false positives

Expected Impact: Accurate overpayment identification; reduced provider burden from false positives; elimination of perverse incentives
7.5 Accountability and Enforcement
17. Personal Liability for Government Officials
Action: Legislation creating personal liability for willful oversight failures
    • Criminal penalties: Officials who knowingly fail to enforce fraud laws 
    • Civil liability: Officials approving contracts to donors without recusal 
    • Debarment: Officials moving to industry they oversaw (5-year cooling-off period) 
    • Enforcement: Independent federal oversight of state Medicaid integrity 
Expected Impact: Increased official accountability; reduced political protection of fraudsters
18. RICO Charges for Organizations Facilitating Fraud
Action: DOJ aggressive use of RICO statutes against systemic fraud
    • Target: Organizations (MCOs, PBMs) that facilitate fraud through deliberate blindness 
    • Target: Criminal networks operating multiple fraudulent entities 
    • Penalties: Corporate dissolution; seizure of all assets; executive prosecution 
    • Standard: Pattern of willful failure to detect/report fraud = racketeering 
Expected Impact: Deterrent effect on corporate facilitation; accountability for systemic failures
19. Debarment for Fraud Settlement
Action: Automatic debarment from federal programs following fraud settlement
    • Standard: Any fraud settlement >$10M triggers 5-year debarment 
    • Scope: All federal healthcare programs (Medicare, Medicaid, VA, etc.) 
    • Exceptions: None (eliminate current case-by-case determinations) 
    • Subsidiaries: Parent company debarment extends to all subsidiaries 
Expected Impact: Meaningful consequences for fraud; elimination of settle-and-continue pattern
7.6 Public Transparency
20. Public Fraud Dashboard

9. CONCLUSION
9.1 Summary of Findings
This comprehensive investigation of seven state Medicaid programs reveals not isolated failures but a systemic nationwide crisis in managed care oversight that has enabled $50-82 billion in fraud over five years.
The evidence demonstrates:
    1. Identical fraud schemes replicated across all states: Hospice fraud, pharmacy fraud, transportation fraud, risk adjustment fraud, and organized crime penetration follow the same patterns regardless of state.
    2. Identical oversight failures documented: CMS Focused Program Integrity Reviews identified the same MCO failures (no site visits, inadequate staffing, no MFCU referrals, payment suspension violations) across multiple states. Federal enforcement: None.
    3. Identical political dynamics: Campaign donations correlate with favorable contract treatment in all states. Centene settled fraud cases and had contracts renewed. MCO executives appointed to oversight boards. Whistleblowers retaliated against.
    4. Structural design enables fraud: 70-97% of Medicaid flows through MCOs with minimal independent oversight. This is not accident. This is deliberate design choice trading fraud prevention for administrative convenience.
    5. Recovery rate 5-15% nationally: For every $100 stolen, states recover $5-15. Remaining $85-95 stays with fraudsters or disappears overseas. This is not insufficient effort. This is structural inevitability.
    6. International dimension makes recovery impossible: Billions transferred to countries with limited cooperation (China, Somalia, Armenia, Pakistan). Historical recovery rate <1%.
    7. Political protection systematic: Not isolated corruption but systemic mechanism where donations purchase influence, contract awards, and protection from consequences.
    8. Organized crime networks established: Armenian OCG (CA), Somali networks (MN), Russian TCO (NY) have made U.S. healthcare fraud core enterprise. Billions available, low detection risk, lenient sentences.
    9. Federal oversight failure: CMS documents violations of federal regulations. Issues "observations." No enforcement. Violations continue for years, even decades.
    10. Whistleblower dependency reveals system failure: Most major fraud detected by private citizens risking careers, not by official systems designed and funded for detection.
9.2 The Central Question
Why does this system persist?
Not because officials unaware of fraud.
    • CMS has documented failures for years 
    • State auditors have identified vulnerabilities 
    • Whistleblowers have brought evidence 
    • Congressional hearings have exposed problems 
    • Media investigations have revealed schemes 
Not because solutions unknown.
    • Independent MCO audits would detect fraud 
    • Real-time data verification would prevent payment to deceased 
    • GPS tracking would eliminate ghost trips 
    • Unannounced site visits would catch phantom providers 
    • Algorithm transparency would enable accountability 
    • Ban on political donations would eliminate protection 
    • Enforcement of federal payment suspension law would stop fraud continuation 
The system persists because the incentive structure makes fraud-tolerant behavior rational for all actors:
MCOs rationally tolerate fraud because fraud-inflated spending justifies higher capitation rates (higher revenue) while aggressive detection costs money (lower profit).
Politicians rationally protect fraud because MCO industry is major donor and aggressive enforcement would disrupt industry donating to campaigns.
States rationally avoid independent MCO audits because:
    1. MCO industry lobbies against oversight 
    2. Audits cost money (politically difficult to fund) 
    3. Finding fraud requires acknowledging previous failures (politically embarrassing) 
    4. Finding fraud may require returning federal funds (reduces state budget) 
Federal regulators rationally avoid enforcement because:
    1. States resist federal intervention in Medicaid 
    2. MCO industry lobbies heavily at federal level 
    3. Enforcement creates political conflict 
    4. Easier to issue "observations" than enforce compliance 
Fraudsters rationally commit fraud because:
    1. Detection low (5-15% recovery rate) 
    2. Consequences minimal (85-95% keeps proceeds) 
    3. International transfers unrecoverable 
    4. Political protection available through donations 
    5. If caught, settlements typically <10% of fraud proceeds 
This is not broken system. This is system working exactly as its incentive structure dictates.
9.3 What Reform Requires
Meaningful reform requires breaking these incentive structures:
For MCOs:
    • Independent audits (removes self-audit conflict) 
    • Fraud detection performance tied to capitation rates (aligns incentives) 
    • Debarment for fraud settlements (creates meaningful consequences) 
For Politicians:
    • Ban donations from Medicaid contractors (eliminates protection incentive) 
    • Personal liability for willful oversight failures (creates accountability) 
    • Public transparency dashboard (enables public pressure) 
For States:
    • Federal enforcement of payment suspension (removes state discretion) 
    • Mandatory MCO-to-MFCU referrals (eliminates bottleneck) 
    • Federal funding for independent audits (removes cost barrier) 
For Federal Regulators:
    • Enforcement action, not observations (creates consequences) 
    • Financial penalties for non-compliance (makes violations costly) 
    • Debarment authority (removes bad actors) 
For Fraudsters:
    • Automatic payment suspension (stops fraud immediately) 
    • Real-time verification (prevents fraud execution) 
    • International asset freezes (stops overseas transfers) 
    • RICO prosecution (creates severe consequences) 
Without These Changes:
The system will continue producing the same results:
    • $10-20B annual fraud 
    • 5-15% recovery rate 
    • Political protection of fraudsters 
    • MCO contracts renewed despite fraud 
    • Organized crime expansion 
    • Whistleblower retaliation 
    • Federal regulations unenforced 
    • Billions lost overseas 
With These Changes:
Fraud would become:
    • Detectable (independent audits, real-time verification) 
    • Stoppable (payment suspension, asset freezes) 
    • Costly (debarment, RICO, personal liability) 
    • Unprofitable (low success rate, high consequence) 
    • Unprotected (donation ban, transparency) 
9.4 Final Assessment
This investigation began with Minnesota's $9 billion scandal. It revealed seven states with combined fraud of $50-82 billion over five years.
But the true scale is larger.
These seven states represent ~40% of national Medicaid enrollment. If fraud rates similar nationally:
National Medicaid Fraud Estimate (5-year): $125-205 billion
This is not hyperbole. This is extrapolation from documented state-level fraud rates applied to national Medicaid spending (~$750B annually).
The question is not whether fraud on this scale exists.
The evidence demonstrates it does.
The question is whether we have the political will to:
    1. Acknowledge the scale 
    2. Implement structural reforms 
    3. Enforce federal regulations 
    4. Break the political protection mechanisms 
    5. Hold bad actors accountable 
This report provides:
    • Documentation of the fraud 
    • Analysis of the mechanisms 
    • Identification of the failures 
    • Recommendations for reform 
What happens next depends on whether the evidence is acted upon or ignored.
The fraud continues. The money flows. The system persists.
Until we decide to change it.
