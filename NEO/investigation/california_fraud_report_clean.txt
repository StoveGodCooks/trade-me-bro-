CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT FRAUD INVESTIGATION  Comprehensive Research Summary — January 2026  EXPANDED EDITION WITH DETAILED FRAUD MECHANISMS   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Congress has directly compared California's healthcare fraud crisis to Minnesota: "Gavin Newsom's California could just as well be another Minnesota" (Rep. Jason Smith, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman, December 2025). The parallels between these two states reveal a disturbing national pattern. Both cases demonstrate how government-created oversight gaps combine with political protection mechanisms to enable massive fraud schemes that drain billions from taxpayer-funded healthcare programs meant to serve America's most vulnerable populations. California's fraud crisis encompasses multiple interconnected schemes: a single pharmacy that exploited suspended safeguards to steal $204 million in ten months; an explosion of hospice providers that grew by 1,589% while national numbers declined; Armenian organized crime networks that established Los Angeles County as their U.S. headquarters for healthcare fraud operations; and a pay-to-play political environment where $10.6 million in campaign donations correlated with $6.3 billion in state payments. This investigation documents not just the fraud schemes themselves, but the systematic institutional failures, political connections, and protection mechanisms that allowed them to flourish.   1. CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND POLITICAL CONNECTIONS  THE PAY-TO-PLAY PATTERN: HOW IT WORKS The core mechanism of California's political corruption is straightforward: companies make campaign donations, then receive disproportionate state contracts. This creates a system where access to government money depends more on political relationships than competitive merit. Open the Books Investigation Finding: The investigative watchdog group discovered that 979 state vendors who gave $10,561,828 in political donations to Gavin Newsom during his 2010, 2018, recall election, and 2022 election cycles received $6,201,978,173 in state payments in return. That represents a $10.6 million investment yielding a $6.3 billion return—a ratio of roughly 587:1. For every dollar these companies donated to Newsom's political campaigns, they received $587 back in state contracts.  Blue Shield of California: A 16-Year Relationship Examined The relationship between Blue Shield of California and Gavin Newsom illustrates how pay-to-play operates over time. The pattern shows donations consistently preceding favorable treatment, contracts, and policy decisions. Blue Shield's first documented check to Newsom arrived in 2005: $25,000 for "Project Homeless Connect" when he served as San Francisco's Mayor. This initial contribution established a relationship that would grow dramatically as Newsom's political career advanced. California Healthline documented that over the subsequent 16 years, as Newsom moved from Mayor to Lieutenant Governor to Governor, Blue Shield became one of his most generous and trusted supporters. | Year | Amount | Purpose | What Followed | ||--||| | 2002-2018 | ~$23 million total | Campaigns and special causes | Political ascent | | 2019 | $100,000 | Newsom inaugural fund | Administration access | | January 2020 | $20 million | Project Homekey (homelessness fund) | See below | | 2020 | $300,000 | Commission on Future of Work nonprofit | Policy influence | | 2020 | $15 million | No-bid COVID vaccination contract | Contract award | The Critical Sequence in 2020: In January 2020, Blue Shield donated $20 million to Newsom's homelessness fund. That same year, Blue Shield's CEO was recruited to help shape the state's COVID-19 testing strategy. Blue Shield then received the vaccine distribution contract without competitive bidding. The sequence demonstrates how donations create access, access creates influence, and influence creates contracts. The December 2022 Backroom Deal: A "backroom agreement" reversed the results of a long-planned competitive bidding process among commercial health plans. Blue Shield, which had initially been shut out of the competition, was suddenly given San Diego County. Meanwhile, Health Net (a Centene subsidiary) that the state had planned to remove from Los Angeles County for being "among lowest performers" was allowed to stay. The state's official explanation—to "balance enrollment"—did not address why competitive bidding results were overturned. Centene's Donation History: The company whose subsidiary benefited from the backroom deal had given Newsom $242,550 in donations, including $121,800 directly from CEO Michael Neidorff.  Major Healthcare Companies: Donations Versus State Payments | Company | Campaign Donations | State Payments Received | Ratio | ||-||-| | Anthem Blue Cross | $69,305 | $844,875,535 | 12,191:1 | | Centene/Health Net | $242,550 | $206,155,778 | 850:1 | | Kaiser Permanente | $35,910 | $172,217,805 | 4,795:1 | | Blue Shield | $102,550 + $20M behested | $74,283,100 | (Complex) | | UnitedHealth | $130,000 + $100K inaugural | $315+ million no-bid contracts | 1,369:1 | Combined Total: Major healthcare companies gave $691,615 in direct donations and received $1.9 billion in state payments. This does not include the $20 million in "behested payments" Blue Shield made to Newsom's favored causes.  The No-Bid Contract Pattern: How Donations Convert to Contracts No-bid contracts represent the most direct conversion of political donations into government money. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Newsom administration awarded billions in contracts without competitive bidding to companies with documented donation histories. | Donor | Donation | No-Bid Contract | The Connection | |-|-|--|-| | BYD (President donated) | $40,000 | $990 million + $316M extension for masks | Chinese company with minimal US presence received largest state contract | | UnitedHealth | $189,000 | $177 million testing + $315 million data tracking | Two separate contracts without competition | | Blue Shield | $23 million over time | $15 million vaccine distribution | CEO recruited to advisory role first | | Bloom Energy | Favorable press | Ventilator refurbishment deal | CEO publicly praised Newsom at press conference | The Bloom Energy case is particularly revealing. At a press conference, Bloom Energy's CEO stated: "There are wartime leaders and there are peacetime leaders. You're a great peacetime leader, but you're showing you're an amazing wartime leader." This public flattery accompanied favorable contract treatment.  "Behested Payments": The Legal Loophole Explained Behested payments represent a legal mechanism for unlimited political influence that most citizens have never heard of. Unlike campaign contributions, which are regulated and capped, behested payments are donations that elected officials solicit from private parties for third-party causes. There are no limits on these payments, and they receive less regulatory scrutiny than direct campaign contributions. The mechanism works as follows: A politician identifies a cause or organization they want to support. They then ask companies, wealthy individuals, or other interests to donate to that cause. The donor gains favor with the politician, the cause receives funding, and the payment technically never enters the politician's campaign accounts. The numbers reveal how aggressively this loophole was exploited: - 2019: Newsom solicited approximately $12 million in behested payments - 2020: Newsom solicited approximately $227 million in behested payments - Increase: 19 times more than the previous year The top donors in 2020 included Facebook ($27 million), Blue Shield ($20 million), and Google ($10 million)—all companies with significant interests before state government. Loyola Law School Professor Jessica Levinson provided expert analysis: Some believe such contributions "are the devil's work, and they're clearly a loophole around contribution limits and people just give them to curry favor with elected officials."  The First Partner's Charity Jennifer Siebel Newsom's nonprofit organization "The Representation Project" received donations from state vendors while those vendors received billions in state payments. Open the Books documented that the same companies giving to this charity were simultaneously receiving government contracts. The Sacramento Bee and Washington Post previously identified these companies and their dual role as both charitable donors and state contractors.  Conflict of Interest at the State Legislature Assembly Health Committee chair Mia Bonta is the wife of Attorney General Rob Bonta, who leads the state agency responsible for prosecuting healthcare fraud. She has been criticized for not recusing herself in votes relating to her husband's agency. This creates a structural conflict where the person overseeing healthcare legislation is married to the person whose agency determines which healthcare fraud cases to pursue.  Attorney General Rob Bonta's Dismissal of Fraud Concerns When the Trump administration announced investigations into Medicaid spending, Attorney General Bonta responded with blanket dismissal rather than engagement: > "The whole idea that there's waste, fraud, and abuse is contrived. It's manufactured. It's invented. It's a catchall phrase they use to justify their predetermined anti-immigrant agenda." This statement dismissing the "whole idea" of waste, fraud, and abuse as "contrived" and "manufactured" came from the state's chief law enforcement officer responsible for prosecuting such fraud. The response mirrors Minnesota's political protection pattern, where criticism of fraud was deflected as racist rather than addressed on its merits.  Campaign Donations Versus Single-Payer Healthcare Policy While Newsom campaigned on supporting single-payer healthcare, the insurance companies opposing such legislation are among his top donors: - Blue Shield: Donated $99,000+ to campaigns, $2.7 million to CA Democratic Party - Anthem: $78,000 to campaigns, $770,000 to CA Democratic Party - UnitedHealth: $130,000 to campaigns, $513,000 to state party All three companies actively lobby against single-payer healthcare and participate in a coalition claiming it "would create a new and exorbitantly expensive government bureaucracy." The disconnect between Newsom's stated policy position and his donor base illustrates how campaign finance can create conflicts between political promises and governing decisions.   2. DHCS LEADERSHIP AND THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION SUSPENSION  THE DECISION CHAIN: HOW THE FRAUD WINDOW OPENED Understanding how a single pharmacy could steal $204 million in ten months requires tracing the decisions that created the opportunity. Each step in this chain removed a safeguard against fraud. Step 1: The Executive Order (January 7, 2019) Governor Gavin Newsom signed Executive Order N-01-19, ordering the transition of Medi-Cal pharmacy services from managed care to fee-for-service. This was a major structural change affecting how the state's 14+ million Medi-Cal beneficiaries receive prescription medications. Step 2: The Contract Award (December 13, 2019) DHCS awarded the Medi-Cal Rx contract to Magellan Medicaid Administration, Inc. This company would manage the new prescription drug system for the state's entire Medicaid population. Step 3: The Acquisition Creates Conflict (January 2021) Centene Corporation announced its acquisition of Magellan. This created a massive conflict of interest because Centene already operated managed care plans and pharmacies in California. The company was now positioned to manage the state's prescription drug system while simultaneously competing with other providers in that same system. Step 4: New Leadership Arrives (September 10, 2021) Michelle Baass was appointed DHCS Director by Governor Newsom. She brought 20 years of state government experience, having served as Undersecretary of California Health and Human Services Agency (2018-2021) and Deputy Secretary of the Office of Program and Fiscal Affairs (2017-2018). Her earlier career included working as a manager and consultant at Accenture from 1996 to 2004. Step 5: The System Goes Live and Safeguards Are Suspended (January 1, 2022) Medi-Cal Rx went live. Crucially, prior authorization requirements were suspended during the transition period. The Pharmacy Transition Policy stated: "DHCS will not require any PA during the 180-day period for covered Medi-Cal pharmacy benefits billed on pharmacy claims." This single decision meant that pharmacies could bill for high-cost drugs without any verification that the prescriptions were medically necessary or even that the medications were actually dispensed to patients.  HOW THE MONTE VISTA PHARMACY FRAUD WORKED The Monte Vista Pharmacy case provides a detailed blueprint for how fraud exploits suspended safeguards. The scheme was sophisticated, profitable, and continued for ten months before detection. The Players: - Kyrollos Mekail (36, Moreno Valley) — Licensed California pharmacist, owner and pharmacist-in-charge of Monte Vista Pharmacy in Montclair - Co-Schemer 1 — Received kickbacks of up to 40% of fraudulent revenue for referring prescriptions - Co-Schemer 2 — Medical professional who signed prescriptions for payment The Mechanism: 1. The suspended prior authorization meant Monte Vista could bill for expensive medications without proving medical necessity 2. Co-Schemer 1 would identify Medi-Cal beneficiaries whose insurance could be billed 3. Co-Schemer 2 would sign prescriptions for those patients, receiving payment for each signature 4. Monte Vista would bill Medi-Cal for 19 expensive, non-contracted drugs containing low-cost, generic ingredients 5. Many prescriptions were for medications that were medically unnecessary or never actually dispensed 6. Some medications billed included Folite tablets—a vitamin available over the counter 7. Medi-Cal paid the claims because the prior authorization safeguard had been removed The Numbers: - Fraud Period: May 2022 to March 2023 (under one year) - Amount Billed: $306,521,392 - Amount Paid by Medi-Cal: $204,032,151 - Kickbacks Paid: $36 million (disguised as "consulting services") - Kickback Rate: Up to 40% of Monte Vista's revenue from fraudulent claims The Billing Pattern That Should Have Triggered Alarms: Monte Vista Pharmacy was billing Medi-Cal "tens of millions of dollars per month" for high-reimbursement generic drugs. A single pharmacy billing amounts that would place it among the highest-volume pharmacies in the state should have triggered automated fraud detection. Instead, payments continued for ten months. The July 2025 Expansion: Federal prosecutors later charged additional co-conspirators. The expanded case revealed that from May 2022 to April 2023, the network billed Medi-Cal more than $269 million and was paid more than $178 million through Monte Vista Pharmacy. The co-conspirators included: - Marshall Randall — Orange County man with prior federal convictions, previously worked with Michael D. Drobot in the Pacific Hospital kickback scandal - Patricia Anderson (57, West Hills) — Charged with health care fraud for her role in the scheme Randall and others allegedly laundered their illicit proceeds by transferring the Medi-Cal fraud proceeds to third parties to pay kickbacks, promote the fraud scheme, and conceal and disguise the transfers from law enforcement detection. Mekail pleaded guilty to criminal charges in August 2024 and awaits sentencing.  THE MAGELLAN DISASTER: BOTCHED ROLLOUT The Medi-Cal Rx transition created immediate problems beyond enabling fraud. In February 2022, multiple reports emerged of a "botched" rollout: - 95,000+ Californians were not receiving their medications - Healthcare providers reported "life and death situations" - Medi-Cal managed care organizations protested that the Centene-owned system gave Centene access to all their competitors' pharmacy data California Globe reported that Newsom had awarded Magellan the pharmacy benefit manager contract despite the fact that Centene's acquisition "gives Centene access to all of their competitor's pharmacy data." The structural conflict of interest was creating both patient harm and market distortion.  CENTENE'S FRAUD HISTORY While California was giving Centene's subsidiary the Medi-Cal Rx contract, the parent company was settling fraud allegations across multiple states: | State | Settlement Amount | Year | |-||| | Illinois | $56.7 million | 2021 | | Arkansas | $15.2 million | 2021 | | Multiple states | $1+ billion reserve | 2021 | Bloomberg Law (December 2021) reported that Centene "set aside just over $1 billion to cover future anticipated settlements with state attorneys general related to fraudulent billing charges across multiple states." California awarded a contract worth billions in prescription drug management to a company's subsidiary while the parent company was simultaneously reserving a billion dollars for fraud settlements in other states.  L.A. CARE SYSTEMIC FAILURES Under DHCS oversight, L.A. Care Health Plan (the state's largest Medi-Cal plan) accumulated failures so severe that it was fined $55 million for documented harms to patients: - 41,500 instances of failing to timely issue grievance resolution letters (2019-2021) - 92,854 instances of prior authorization requests not processed timely - Backlogs of 9,125+ authorization requests - Documented Patient Harm: Cancer patients with deteriorating health experienced treatment delays; one patient given a 6-9 month prognosis disenrolled from L.A. Care due to delays  CMS FINDINGS ON DHCS MCO OVERSIGHT The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) conducted a Focused Program Integrity Review of California's Medi-Cal program. Their findings revealed systematic oversight failures: - "CMS believes the number of investigations referred to DHCS is low for a Medicaid program" of California's size - "The state does not track credible allegations of fraud based on referrals for MCOs" - "The state does not review and approve the compliance plan or the fraud, waste, and abuse plan" of Managed Care Organizations - MCOs and DHCS reported differing data on investigations referred—meaning the state couldn't accurately track fraud referrals The OIG recommended that DHCS should "increase fraud referrals from managed care organizations." This is the exact same oversight gap identified in Minnesota, where approximately 80% of Medicaid payments flow through MCOs with minimal independent fraud oversight.   3. WHISTLEBLOWER CASES: THE REAL SOURCE OF FRAUD DETECTION  THE PATTERN: WHISTLEBLOWERS DRIVE MAJOR RECOVERIES California's fraud detection system relies overwhelmingly on private citizens—often current or former employees—who risk their careers to expose wrongdoing. The vast majority of major Medi-Cal fraud settlements come from whistleblower qui tam cases, not from state-initiated investigations or MCO referrals. This pattern reveals a critical failure: the state's official fraud detection mechanisms are not working. Instead, California depends on individuals willing to come forward despite significant personal risk.  Gold Coast Health Plan — $70.7 MILLION (2022) The Whistleblowers: - Atul Maithel — Gold Coast's former controller (chief accounting officer) - Andre Galvan — Gold Coast's former director of member services How the Fraud Worked: Gold Coast Health Plan realized it was sitting on Adult Expansion money from the Affordable Care Act that would have to be returned to California if not spent on patient care. Rather than returning these excess funds as required, Gold Coast leadership devised a scheme to distribute the money to "favored providers" through fraudulent means: 1. Providers would produce "arbitrary lists" of services they claimed to have provided 2. These lists included services not actually provided, duplicative services already reimbursed, and pre-determined payments not reflecting fair market value 3. "Additional services" billed included items as trivial as phone calls, health fairs, and hotel vouchers 4. Providers would send these lists to Gold Coast and receive checks in return 5. The scheme allowed Gold Coast to appear compliant with spending requirements while actually funneling money to preferred relationships Timeline Showing How Long Justice Takes: - 2015: Qui tam lawsuit filed - 2016: First Amended Complaint - 2019: Second Amended Complaint - August 2022: $70.7 million settlement Seven years elapsed between the whistleblowers filing their complaint and achieving a settlement. During this time, both whistleblowers were former employees—meaning they had to leave their positions to pursue the case.  CenCal Health — $95.5 MILLION (2023) The Whistleblower: Dr. Julio Bordas How the Fraud Worked: CenCal Health inflated its Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) reported to DHCS. The MLR measures what percentage of premium revenue an insurer spends on actual healthcare versus administrative costs and profit. By inflating its reported MLR, CenCal avoided refunding tens of millions of dollars in surplus funding that should have been returned to the state. The case required seven separate settlements with CenCal and seven hospitals/clinics that participated in the scheme. Edward Arens of Phillips & Cohen LLP explained the harm: "Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) inflation takes scarce healthcare dollars away from patients who need it and harms taxpayers."  Additional Whistleblower Cases | Case | Settlement | Whistleblower | What Was Exposed | Years to Resolve | Reward | ||--||||--| | Cottage Health System | $5M | Dr. Julio Bordas | Improper Medi-Cal billing | Multi-year | $950,000 | | Alta Vista Healthcare | $3.825M | Neyirys Orozco (former accounting employee) | Illegal kickbacks to physicians for referrals | Multi-year | $581,094 | | CVS Pharmacy | $18.2M | CVS pharmacist (filed 2019) | Dispensed drugs for unapproved conditions, billed Medi-Cal | 6 years | ~$3.3 million | | ReNew Health | $7.084M | Bay Area partners | False COVID-19 Waiver Program claims | 4 years | $1,204,280 | CVS Case Details: CVS did not properly confirm or document required diagnoses for "Code 1" drugs. CVS even dispensed drugs for unapproved conditions, then knowingly billed Medi-Cal despite knowing the prescriptions did not meet billing requirements. ReNew Health Case Details: This was the first False Claims Act case related to COVID-19 Waiver Program abuse. ReNew Health (which owns dozens of California nursing facilities) submitted false Medicare claims representing that residents needed skilled care based on COVID exposure when they did not. The company exploited pandemic emergency measures to bill for unnecessary services.  Contra Costa Health ECM Program — ONGOING CONCERNS A current whistleblower (a nurse) has alleged serious problems with Contra Costa Health's Enhanced Care Management program: - The program has "abandoned medical assistance altogether" - Case managers have been instructed to focus only on social needs while ignoring clinical needs - Cutting corners allows inflating caseload sizes to obtain more state funding - Contra Costa Health received $2.5 billion in Medi-Cal revenue (2022-2023 combined) The whistleblower explained the fraud mechanism: "It gives them an excuse to really inflate caseload sizes. Because by ignoring clinical needs there, then it's okay; it's totally manageable to manage just the social needs of 100 patients." State Response: DHCS said it "will continue to monitor"—but the whistleblower is "not confident in the state's response."  THE WHISTLEBLOWER PATTERN: What the Data Reveals | Case | Settlement | Years to Resolve | Whistleblower Status at Outcome | ||--||--| | Gold Coast | $70.7M | 7 years | Former employees | | CenCal | $95.5M | 3+ years | External doctor | | Cottage Health | $5M | Multi-year | External doctor | | Alta Vista | $3.825M | Multi-year | Former employee | | CVS | $18.2M | 6 years | Employee | | ReNew | $7.084M | 4 years | External | Total recovered from these whistleblower cases: approximately $200 million The Common Thread: Whistleblowers who are current employees risk severe retaliation. Most successful whistleblowers are either former employees who have already left, or external parties (like physicians) who observed fraud from outside the organization.  California False Claims Act Protections California law provides protections for whistleblowers, including: - Reinstatement with seniority - Two times back pay with interest - Compensation for special damages - Punitive damages where appropriate - Attorney's fees Whistleblower reward: 15-25% of recovery when the government joins the case Despite these legal protections, the pattern of successful whistleblowers being former employees suggests the protections are insufficient to prevent career destruction.  OIG Finding on Detection Failure The California MFCU (Medicaid Fraud Control Unit) inspection found that the Unit "experienced challenges maintaining adequate staffing levels" and had difficulty obtaining fraud referrals from MCOs. The successful Gold Coast case—the state's largest Medi-Cal fraud settlement—was whistleblower-driven, not discovered by state oversight.   4. THE 112 HOSPICES AT ONE ADDRESS  CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS (December 2025) House Energy and Commerce Committee members wrote to HHS OIG with alarming findings: > "Auditors have reported an unprecedented jump in home health and hospice fraud in Los Angeles County, California—including one report showing 112 different hospices located at the same physical address." This single statistic encapsulates the absurdity of California's hospice fraud crisis. Hospice care requires physical facilities, medical staff, and patient care infrastructure. Having 112 separate hospice companies operate from a single address is a mathematical impossibility for legitimate businesses.  LA COUNTY HOSPICE EXPLOSION | Year | LA County Hospices | Change from Baseline | ||-|| | 2010 | ~115 | Baseline | | 2022 | 1,841 | +1,589% | | Current | ~2,889 (statewide) | Moratorium now in effect | The National Context: - Los Angeles County hospice growth from 1983-2024 exceeded the combined growth of 36 states - 15 new hospices received Medicare certification, all operating from the same two-story building in Los Angeles - 94% of California hospice agencies are for-profit companies (versus nonprofit hospices that have different incentive structures)  HOME HEALTH AGENCY EXPLOSION (Same Pattern) | Metric | United States (2019-2023) | LA County (2019-2023) | |--||-| | Change in HHAs | 8,838 → 8,280 (-6%) | 896 → 1,309 (+46%) | | New enrollments (5 years) | Varied by region | 1,400+ | | Share of California HHAs | — | 50%+ | | Share of National HHAs | 100% | ~14% | While the United States as a whole saw a 6% decrease in home health agencies, Los Angeles County experienced a 46% increase. Los Angeles County now contains more than half of all California home health agencies and nearly 14% of all home health agencies in the entire country.  ARMENIAN ORGANIZED CRIME: A HEALTHCARE FRAUD NETWORK Historical Context (2010): Armenian organized crime's entry into healthcare fraud made national headlines with a $163 million scheme that the Department of Justice called "the largest Medicare fraud by a single criminal enterprise in history." The operation involved: - 73 defendants - 118 fake clinics across 25 states - Leadership by "vor" (godfather) Armen Kazarian of Glendale, California - U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara stated the scheme "puts the traditional Mafia to shame" - $35 million was paid out before the scheme was caught The Current Operations: According to federal court filings from 2025, Armenian Organized Crime is a "Russian mafia-affiliated transnational criminal organization" that has made Los Angeles County a center of U.S. operations. Since 2022, two local leaders within the organization (known as "avtoritet," meaning "authority" in Russian) have allegedly engaged in a power struggle for territorial control, resulting in multiple murder attempts and a kidnapping. The organization's activities extend beyond healthcare fraud to include bank fraud, wire fraud, "cargo theft" targeting online retailers like Amazon, extortion, kidnapping, and violence. However, healthcare fraud provides a particularly attractive profit center because Medicare and Medi-Cal will automatically pay claims, and the penalties for getting caught are far less severe than for violent crimes. May 2025 Enforcement Action: The Health Care Fraud Strike Force dismantled five hospices in the greater Los Angeles area following a multi-year investigation into Armenian Organized Crime. This represented a significant disruption but not an elimination of the network's healthcare fraud operations.  HOUSE OF ANGELS HOSPICE NETWORK — SENTENCING COMPLETE This case provides a detailed picture of how hospice fraud networks operate. | Defendant | Sentence | Restitution Ordered | Role in Scheme | |--|-||-| | Petros Fichidzhyan | 12 years | $17,129,060 | Mastermind/organizer | | Juan Carlos Esparza | 57 months | $1,825,012 | House of Angels owner | | Karpis Srapyan | 57 months | $3,203,574 | Co-schemer | | Mihran Panosyan | 57 months | $4,680,146 | Money launderer | | Susanna Harutyunyan | 15 months + deportation | $2,822,963 | Money launderer | Total Medicare fraud: Nearly $16 million through four sham hospices operating from July 2019 until January 2023. How the Scheme Worked: 1. Using Foreign Nationals as Straw Owners: Fichidzhyan and his co-conspirators used foreign nationals' personal identifying information to act as "straw owners" for the hospice companies. These individuals' names appeared on Medicare applications, bank accounts, property leases, and cell phone accounts—but they did not actually control the businesses. 2. Opening Bank Accounts Under False Identities: The conspirators opened bank accounts in the foreign nationals' names to receive Medicare payments, creating a layer of separation between themselves and the fraud proceeds. 3. Misappropriating Physician Identities: The scheme billed Medicare using the names of doctors who never treated the patients—including two deceased physicians. When one living doctor confronted Fichidzhyan about the unauthorized use of his identity, Fichidzhyan paid him $11,000 as hush money. 4. Billing for Non-Existent Services: The hospices billed Medicare for services that were medically unnecessary and never provided. Hospice care is intended for patients with terminal diagnoses and six months or less to live. The scheme enrolled patients who did not meet these criteria. 5. Money Laundering: The conspirators moved funds through a dozen shell and third-party bank accounts. They maintained fraudulent identification documents, bank documents, checkbooks, and credit/debit cards at residential properties. Fichidzhyan alone laundered $5.3+ million through shell companies. He also ran a separate $1+ million home health fraud using another doctor's stolen identity. Government Seizures: - $2,920,383 seized from bank accounts - Home purchased with fraudulent proceeds ordered forfeited - Two additional homes ordered forfeited at sentencing (May 2025) The Recovery Gap: The total restitution ordered ($29+ million) vastly exceeds the amount actually seized ($2.9 million + two homes). Most of the fraud proceeds are unrecoverable.  SHAKLIAN/ALEXSANIAN NETWORK — PENDING ($54M) Arrested: October 9, 2024 (24-count indictment) | Defendant | Charges | Potential Sentence | |--||-| | Sophia Shaklian (36, Los Angeles) | 16 counts healthcare fraud, 4 counts money laundering | 10 years each healthcare fraud count, 20 years each money laundering count | | Alex Alexsanian (47, Burbank) | 1 count conspiracy, 3 counts concealment money laundering | 20 years each count | The Scheme (March 2019 — August 2024): Shaklian used 7 healthcare providers to submit fraudulent claims: - Chateau d'Lumina Hospice - Saint Gorge Radiology - Console Hospice - Hope Diagnostics - Direct Imaging & Diagnostics - Lab One - Labtech - Lifescan Diagnostics Total claims submitted: $54+ million Amount paid by Medicare: $23+ million The Money Laundering Innovation — Gold: - Shaklian created a synthetic identity: "Varsenic Babaian" - Medicare funds were transferred to accounts under this fake name - Alexsanian instructed a foreign national to open Saint Gorge Radiology - That foreign national has since fled the country - The conspirators purchased $6+ million in gold bars and coins to launder proceeds Gold provides an ideal money laundering vehicle: it's portable, retains value, doesn't require bank accounts, can be sold internationally, and is difficult for investigators to trace.  THE "CHURN AND BURN" METHOD CMS has documented a specific pattern used by hospice fraud networks: > "A new hospice opens and starts billing, but once that hospice is audited or reaches its statutory yearly payment limit, it shuts down, keeps the money, buys a new Medicare billing number, transfers its patients over to the new Medicare billing number, and starts billing again." This explains the explosive growth in hospice registrations—many are actually the same criminal networks cycling through new identities. A single fraud organization might operate sequentially as five, ten, or more "different" hospice companies, each billing Medicare until heat arrives, then shutting down and reopening under a new name.  STATE AND FEDERAL RESPONSE - Governor Newsom extended moratorium on new hospice licenses until 2027 - CMS implemented "provisional period of enhanced oversight" in California, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas - CMS conducting unannounced site visits to all Medicare-enrolled hospices - Nearly 400 hospices being considered for administrative action as of mid-2024 - But fraud continues — multiple new hospices enrolled even after the ProPublica investigation brought national attention   5. RECOVERY RATES AND MONEY TRAIL — THE GAP  WHAT CALIFORNIA RECOVERED (FY 2024) | Source | Amount | Notes | |--|--|-| | California MFCU Criminal Recoveries | $513 million | 53% of national total | | California MFCU (FY 2021-2023) | $544 million | 180 indictments, 221 convictions | | State AG Recoveries (July 2024-July 2025) | $134.25 million | Led all states | | Central District of CA Federal (July 2024-July 2025) | $297.02 million | Settlement recoveries | FY 2024 California Highlights: - California MFCU alone recovered $513 million—more than a third of the entire national MFCU total - This made California the "central driver" of FY2024 recovery growth - National ROI: MFCUs recovered $3.46 for every $1 spent  WHAT WAS ACTUALLY STOLEN (Known Cases Only) | Case | Amount Billed/Stolen | Status | |||--| | Monte Vista Pharmacy (ONE pharmacy, ONE year) | $306M billed, $204M paid | Pending | | Monte Vista co-conspirators (July 2025) | $269M billed, $178M paid | Pending | | Shaklian/Alexsanian hospice scheme | $54M billed, $23M paid | Pending trial | | Gerardo Santillan home health network | $60 million | Pending | | House of Angels hospice network | $16 million paid | $29.7M restitution ordered | | Oscar Abrons prescription diversion | $20 million | Pending | | EDD Unemployment Fraud | $20-32.6 billion | Minimal recovery | Total documented in known major cases: $600+ million in a handful of cases alone  THE RECOVERY GAP California Attorney General's office acknowledges the scale of the problem: > "Based on government and private studies, and on the hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud the Division of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse frequently recovers in a single year, the amount stolen from Californians by Medi-Cal fraud could reach billions of dollars annually." The Math: - Recovered FY 2024: ~$513 million (MFCU) + ~$134 million (state AG) + ~$297 million (federal CD-CA) = ~$944 million - Estimated annual fraud: "Billions" - Recovery rate: Potentially less than 10%  MONEY TRAIL: WHERE DOES IT GO? Pattern 1: Gold and Precious Metals The Shaklian/Alexsanian case revealed $6+ million in gold bars and coins purchased with Medicare fraud proceeds. Gold is easily transportable, difficult to trace, retains value, and can be sold internationally without traditional banking systems. Pattern 2: Overseas Transfers - Foreign nationals flee before prosecution (Saint Gorge Radiology principal has fled the country) - Money flows to Armenia and other countries through wire transfers - Recovery rate for overseas transfers: less than 1% (similar to Minnesota's experience with transfers to Kenya, Turkey, and other destinations) Pattern 3: Real Estate - Fichidzhyan: Home purchased with fraud proceeds (ordered forfeited) plus two additional homes forfeited at sentencing - Properties used in schemes often titled to shell companies or straw owners to obscure beneficial ownership Pattern 4: Shell Companies - Fichidzhyan used a dozen-plus shell companies to launder $5.3+ million - Multiple layers of corporate entities obscure ownership and make tracing funds difficult - Bank accounts opened in fake names (like "Varsenic Babaian") Pattern 5: Identity Fraud - Foreign nationals' identifications used as straw owners - Deceased physicians' identities used for Medicare billing - Synthetic identities created for financial accounts  WHAT'S ACTUALLY RECOVERED VERSUS ORDERED | Case | Restitution Ordered | Actually Seized | Recovery Rate | ||-|--|| | House of Angels (Fichidzhyan) | $17,129,060 | $2,920,383 + 2 homes | ~17% | | Shaklian/Alexsanian | TBD | $6M+ in gold | Unknown | | Monte Vista | TBD | Unknown | Unknown | The Harsh Reality: Restitution orders often go uncollected. Defendants may be judgment-proof (no assets to seize), funds may have already been transferred overseas, or assets may be hidden in shell companies, gold, or other hard-to-trace forms.  OIG FINDINGS ON CALIFORNIA MFCU DEFICIENCIES The June 2025 OIG inspection found California's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit had significant operational problems: - Claimed $37,000 in unsupported costs - Claimed $1.3 million in unapproved costs - Made excess purchases - Maintained outdated and inaccurate inventory - Improperly claimed indirect costs - Did not consistently report convictions to federal partners within required timeframes - Experienced challenges with staffing - Had issues with "State Medicaid data that limited its ability to investigate and identify allegations of provider fraud"  THE MISSING PIECE: PROACTIVE DETECTION California's fraud detection is primarily reactive, not proactive: - Low MCO referral rates (CMS confirmed) - Staffing challenges - Data quality issues - Most major cases come from whistleblowers, not state detection systems The Minnesota Parallel: Minnesota also had reactive-only fraud detection, which allowed Feeding Our Future to operate for years despite obvious red flags such as impossible meal counts and multiple sites at single addresses. The same structural failure exists in California.   6.

Auditors have reported an unprecedented jump in home health and hospice fraud in Los Angeles County, California—including one report showing 112 different hospices located at the same physical address. With $1.2 billion in improper payments in home health claims and the Inspector General reporting $198 million in suspected hospice fraud, Gavin Newsom's California could just as well be another Minnesota." > > — Rep. Jason Smith, Chairman, House Ways and Means Committee   7.
