Colorado State Investigative Report
Colorado’s Medicaid program, Health First Colorado, operates under a hybrid managed care model known as the Accountable Care Collaborative (ACC). Unlike states that use full-risk capitation for all services, Colorado’s RAEs manage care coordination and behavioral health, while physical health remains largely a fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement model.
System Overview
The Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing (HCPF) is the single state agency responsible for Medicaid administration. The program serves approximately 1.7 million beneficiaries through a network of 93,000 providers. The ACC Phase II, which began in 2018, utilizes seven Regional Accountable Entities (RAEs). Most of these RAEs are operated by large national for-profit insurers or their subsidiaries, such as Northeast Health Partners (supported by Beacon Health Options) and Rocky Mountain Health Plan (a UnitedHealthcare company).
Program integrity is managed by the Audits and Compliance Division within HCPF's Finance Office, which oversees the Program Integrity Section and the Claims Investigation Unit. Colorado also employs a Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC), currently Health Management Systems, Inc. (HMS), to conduct post-payment audits of Medicaid claims. In SFY 2023, the RAC program recovered approximately $\$47$ million in overpayments.
Fraud Case Analysis
Fraud in Colorado often manifests in high-reimbursement niches. A major case involving medically unnecessary genetic cancer screenings resulted in a settlement where the former CEO of Premier Medical, Kevin S. Murdock, agreed to pay over $\$27.5$ million. The scheme, which cost the Medicaid programs of Colorado, Georgia, and South Carolina over $\$ 14$ million in losses, involved paying illegal kickbacks to induce testing for Medicaid recipients regardless of medical necessity. This case was initiated by a qui tam whistleblower, Karen Mathewson, who received a percentage of the recovery under the False Claims Act.
In the managed care sector, the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan agreed to pay $\$581$ million in 2026 to settle allegations of "risk adjustment" fraud. Whistleblowers alleged that Kaiser's Colorado affiliate (CPMG) and others intentionally over-reported the severity of patient diagnoses (upcoding) to receive higher capitation payments from the government. The complaint alleged that Kaiser identified categories of diagnosis codes with "extremely high error rates" as early as 2004 but failed to take corrective action, choosing instead to retain the inflated revenue.
Furthermore, member fraud investigations have seen a significant increase. In SFY 2024-2025, Colorado counties conducted 2,574 investigations of member fraud, a $23\%$ increase from the previous year, resulting in 87 benefit terminations. However, the actual dollar amount recovered for member fraud decreased by $38\%$ to $\$330,821$, largely due to policy guidance stemming from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act which limited overpayment collections for periods falling within the Public Health Emergency.
MCO-Related Fraud and Oversight Failures
A critical failure in Colorado’s oversight is the lack of financial risk for RAEs. Because physical health services are reimbursed via FFS, the RAEs bear "little to no financial risk" and have fewer incentives to aggressively pursue provider overbilling in the medical sector. A 2023 CMS focused review found that RAEs (addressed as MCOs in the report) were non-compliant with federal requirements regarding payment suspensions. Specifically, the MCO general contract required RAEs to suspend payments only at the direction of HCPF, which contradicts federal regulations requiring plans to suspend payments upon notice of a "credible allegation of fraud".
CMS also noted that Denver Health Medical Plan (DHMP) was unaware of its requirement to submit fraud referrals directly to the MFCU, revealing a significant breakdown in the reporting chain. Additionally, there were concerns regarding conflicts of interest in "physician-owned MCOs" that received bonus payments from HCPF, suggesting that the state lacks a robust mechanism to ensure clinical decisions are not influenced by profit-sharing arrangements.
State Blind Spots and Loopholes
The Colorado RAC program has identified several structural loopholes that undermine program integrity. A May 2024 performance evaluation by the Office of the State Auditor revealed that HCPF pays its RAC based on overpayments found (identified), rather than overpayments recovered. This "identification-based" fee structure (guaranteed at $18\%$) creates a perverse incentive for the contractor to perform "overzealous audits" and apply "inconsistent, unclear, or outdated policies" to inflate findings, many of which are later rescinded upon appeal.
Another major loophole is the use of "contract transmittals" to bypass formal contract amendment processes. HCPF used these transmittals to modify the RAC's compensation, despite explicit contract language prohibiting such use. Furthermore, the state failed to verify the credentials of RAC staff, with auditors finding no evidence of required licenses or certifications for over $50\%$ of the contractor’s personnel.
Money Flow and Entity Analysis
The integration of Medicaid fiscal agents and audit contractors in Colorado represents a significant "entity risk." In 2021, Gainwell Technologies, HCPF’s primary Medicaid fiscal agent, acquired HMS (the state’s RAC). This created a potential conflict of interest where the entity responsible for the state's claims processing system now also controls the primary mechanism for auditing that system's errors. HCPF failed to obtain the required conflict of interest disclosures following this acquisition, leaving the program vulnerable to "self-audit" risks.
Lobbying and political giving also play a role in the Colorado Medicaid ecosystem. UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of Rocky Mountain Health Plan, is a major donor to both state political parties and individual candidates. These contributions ensure that the private insurers running the RAEs maintain a favorable relationship with the policymakers who determine their capitated rates and quality bonus structures.
Colorado Medicaid Fraud Metrics (SFY 2024-25)	Total Reported
Aggregate Health First Colorado Savings	$\$48,266,477$
Provider Civil Settlements (MFANU)	$\$45,645,088$
Member Fraud Recoveries	$\$330,821$
Provider Criminal Restitution Identified	$\$139,298$
State Summary
Colorado’s "Managed Fee for Service" model presents a unique set of challenges. While it avoids some of the pitfalls of full capitation, it creates a system where the private entities managing the program (RAEs) lack the financial incentive to police the majority of medical spending. When combined with a RAC program that incentivizes inaccurate overpayment identification and a lack of transparency regarding proprietary care algorithms, the Colorado Medicaid program remains highly susceptible to administrative waste and sophisticated provider fraud.
