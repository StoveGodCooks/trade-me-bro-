Florida State Investigative Report
Florida has one of the most aggressively privatized Medicaid systems in the nation, known as the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) program. Serving over 5 million beneficiaries, the SMMC is designed to shift the vast majority of fiscal risk to private Managed Care Organizations.
System Overview
The Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) is the state’s lead agency for Medicaid. The SMMC program is divided into three primary plan types: Managed Medical Assistance (MMA), Long-Term Care (LTC), and Dental. As of 2025, Florida contracts with sixteen MCOs, including major players like Humana, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, and Community Care Plan.
Florida’s program integrity efforts are split between the AHCA Office of Inspector General (Internal Audit and Investigations) and the Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU). The Florida MFCU is notably well-funded, with a FY 2025 grant of $\$30.5$ million, $75\%$ of which is federally funded. The state utilizes a "Preferred Drug List" (PDL) revised quarterly by a Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee to manage pharmacy costs across its MCO network.
Fraud Case Analysis
Florida is a frequent epicenter for national healthcare fraud "takedowns." In 2025, the DOJ announced charges against 37 defendants in the Southern District of Florida for schemes totaling over $\$ 14.6$ billion in alleged fraud. One prominent case involved Eduardo Tieles Ruiz and his clinic, Newtech Medical Supply, which submitted approximately $\$2.9$ million in fraudulent claims to Medicare and Medicaid for durable medical equipment that was never provided.
Pharmaceutical fraud is a recurrent theme in Florida enforcement. Attorney General James Uthmeier announced a settlement where Gilead Sciences agreed to pay over $\$ 3$ million to the Florida Medicaid program to resolve allegations that the company paid kickbacks to providers to promote its HIV medications. The investigation found that Gilead incentivized providers to prescribe high-cost brand-name drugs like Biktarvy and Genvoya through awards, meals, and travel expenses, leading to millions of dollars in false claims.
Behavioral health fraud, specifically involving psychosocial rehabilitation (PSR) services, also persists. In a Miami-based scheme, Florida Behavior Health, Inc. recruited patients with illegal kickbacks to attend unnecessary PSR services, billing Medicaid for over $\$1.2$ million. Additionally, Physician Partners of America (PPA) in Tampa agreed to a $\$24.5$ million settlement to resolve whistleblower allegations that they billed for unnecessary medical testing and made false statements to obtain SBA loans.
MCO-Related Fraud and Oversight Failures
Despite its heavy reliance on MCOs, Florida’s oversight of these entities has significant gaps. A 2025 CMS focused review found that Florida’s interagency coordination was insufficient, specifically identifying that the state’s MOU with the MFCU did not adequately outline procedures for MCOs to refer potential fraud directly to law enforcement. This lack of established procedure violates federal regulations under $\S 455.21(c)(3)(iv)$.
Furthermore, CMS identified that AHCA does not require MCOs to regularly report the results of their "beneficiary verification of services". While MCOs are contractually required to verify that services billed were actually received, the state lacks a mechanism to track the "return on investment" or the effectiveness of these verification efforts. The state was also found to be non-compliant in updating its agreement with the MFCU, which had not been revised in over five years.
State Blind Spots and Loopholes
A major blind spot in Florida is the oversight of Physician-Owned MCOs and their related-party transactions. CMS observations suggested a need for stronger safeguards against conflicts of interest in these arrangements, where the physicians providing the care also share in the profits of the insurer. This creates a vulnerability where medical necessity decisions may be compromised to protect the MCO’s bottom line.
The NEMT (Non-Emergency Medical Transportation) sector also represents a significant loophole. Like New York, Florida has seen numerous schemes where transportation providers bill for "ghost trips" or "deadhead miles" (trips without passengers). Because MCOs often subcontract these services to secondary vendors, the oversight trail becomes fragmented, making it difficult for the state to verify service delivery in real-time.
Money Flow and Entity Analysis
The political influence of Medicaid contractors is perhaps most visible in Florida. Major insurers like Humana and UnitedHealth Group have consistently favored the Florida Republican Party, which oversees the state's Medicaid policy. In one study period, recipients in Florida received over $\$ 1.1$ million from the four largest health insurers, representing $19\%$ of their national giving. Humana alone directed $44\%$ of its state-level political giving to Florida, with the Florida Republican Party as its largest single recipient.
Centene Corporation also maintains a heavy presence in Florida, employing the same "subsidiary donation" strategy used in other states to maximize its political footprint. This capital flow is often followed by favorable contract awards and legislative changes that support the continued expansion of managed care.
Florida MFCU Investigative Outcomes (FY 2024-25 Projection)	Value
Total State/Federal MFCU Funding	$\$30,510,157$
Projected Return on Investment (National Avg)	$\$3.46 \text{ per } \$1.00$
Gilead HIV Settlement Recovery	$\$3,033,238$
Physician Partners of America Settlement	$\$24,500,000$
State Summary
Florida’s Medicaid system is a high-stakes environment where multi-billion-dollar corporate interests and sophisticated criminal networks compete for public funds. While the state's MFCU is highly effective at multi-agency takedowns and pharmaceutical settlements, the structural oversight of the sixteen MCOs that manage the program is plagued by outdated interagency agreements and a lack of granular reporting on service verification. The continued influence of political capital on Medicaid procurement remains a central challenge to ensuring that SMMC dollars are used effectively for patient care.

SUBJECT: State of Florida Medicaid Fraud & Systemic Vulnerabilities
DATE: January 27, 2026
STATUS: COMPLETED

1. STATE OF FLORIDA
A. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
1. System Structure
Florida operates one of the most aggressively privatized Medicaid systems in the United States, utilizing a Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) model. This mandatory managed care program serves over 5 million beneficiaries, effectively shifting the majority of fiscal risk from the state to private entities. The Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) serves as the lead state agency, while program integrity is shared with the Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU).
2. Plan Types
The SMMC is segmented into three primary component plans:
    • Managed Medical Assistance (MMA): Standard acute medical care.
    • Long-Term Care (LTC): Nursing facility and home-based care.
    • Dental: Specialized dental coverage.
3. Key MCOs & Entities
As of 2025, Florida contracts with sixteen (16) Managed Care Organizations (MCOs). Major operators include:
    • Humana
    • UnitedHealthcare Community Plan
    • Community Care Plan
    • Centene Corporation (operates via subsidiaries)
    • Physician-Owned MCOs (unnamed specific entities, but noted as a structural category with conflicts).
4. Oversight & Enforcement
    • AHCA Office of Inspector General: Handles internal audits and investigations.
    • Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU): Housed within the AG’s office; FY 2025 funding is $30.5 million (75% federally funded).
    • Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee: Manages the "Preferred Drug List" (PDL) to control pharmacy costs.
5. Structural Vulnerabilities
The system is heavily reliant on subcontractors for services like Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT), creating a "fragmented oversight trail". Additionally, interagency coordination is contractually outdated, with significant gaps in fraud referral mechanisms between MCOs and the state.

B. FRAUD CASE ANALYSIS
1. Major Criminal & Civil Cases (2024-2025)
    • The "National Takedown" (Southern District of Florida, 2025):
      The DOJ charged 37 defendants in South Florida for schemes totaling $14.6 billion in alleged fraud.
        ? Case Example: Newtech Medical Supply. Owner Eduardo Tieles Ruiz submitted $2.9 million in fraudulent claims for durable medical equipment (DME) that was never provided.
    • Pharmaceutical Kickbacks (Gilead Sciences):
      Attorney General James Uthmeier announced a settlement where Gilead Sciences paid over $3 million to resolve allegations of paying kickbacks to providers.
        ? Scheme: Gilead incentivized providers to prescribe high-cost HIV drugs (Biktarvy and Genvoya) via awards, meals, and travel expenses.
    • Psychosocial Rehabilitation (PSR) Fraud:
      Florida Behavior Health, Inc. (Miami) recruited patients via illegal kickbacks to attend unnecessary PSR services, billing Medicaid over $1.2 million.
    • Whistleblower Settlement (Physician Partners of America - PPA):
      PPA (Tampa) agreed to a $24.5 million settlement.
        ? Allegations: Billing for unnecessary medical testing and making false statements to secure Small Business Administration (SBA) loans.
2. Pattern Analysis
    • Recruitment Kickbacks: A recurring theme where patients are bribed to receive unnecessary services (PSR fraud).
    • "Ghost" Services: Billing for goods (DME) or services (NEMT) never rendered.
    • High-Value Targeting: Pharma fraud focuses on high-cost specialty drugs (HIV medications) to maximize kickback ROI.

C. MCO-RELATED FRAUD & OVERSIGHT FAILURES
1. Failure to Refer Fraud
A 2025 CMS review found that Florida’s MCOs lack a formalized procedure to refer potential fraud directly to law enforcement, violating federal regulation § 455.21(c)(3)(iv). This creates a "bottleneck" where internal MCO investigations may stall or vanish without reaching the MFCU.
2. Lack of Service Verification
MCOs are contractually required to perform "beneficiary verification of services" (confirming patients received care). However, CMS found that:
    • AHCA does not require MCOs to regularly report the results of these verifications.
    • The state lacks any mechanism to track the "return on investment" or effectiveness of these verifications.
3. Physician-Owned MCO Conflicts
A "major blind spot" exists regarding Physician-Owned MCOs. Oversight mechanisms fail to adequately police related-party transactions where the physicians providing care also share in the insurer's profits. This conflict creates vulnerability for compromised medical necessity decisions to protect the MCO's bottom line.

D. STATE BLIND SPOTS & LOOPHOLES
1. Outdated Interagency Agreements
The state’s Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the MFCU has not been revised in over five years, resulting in non-compliance with federal standards and outdated referral protocols.
2. The NEMT Subcontracting Loophole
Non-Emergency Medical Transportation is a high-risk sector. MCOs subcontract these services to secondary vendors, fragmenting the data trail. This prevents real-time state verification, allowing providers to bill for "ghost trips" (trips that never happened) or "deadhead miles" (trips without passengers).
3. Intentional vs. Accidental Weakness
The persistence of these gaps—despite CMS warnings—suggests that the friction between MCO autonomy and state oversight is a structural feature of the SMMC design, prioritizing privatization speed over granular accountability.

E. MONEY FLOW & ENTITY ANALYSIS
1. Political "Pay-to-Play" Dynamics
Medicaid contractors exert significant political influence in Florida:
    • Humana: Directed 44% of its state-level political giving to Florida, with the Florida Republican Party as its largest single recipient.
    • Centene: Utilizes a "subsidiary donation" strategy to maximize footprint.
    • Aggregate Giving: In one period, Florida recipients received $1.1 million from the four largest insurers (19% of their national giving).
    • Outcome: This capital flow often precedes favorable contract awards and legislative support for managed care expansion.
2. Fraudulent Flows
    • Gilead: Funneled millions in "marketing" expenses (meals, travel) to providers to generate false claims for HIV drugs.
    • Florida Behavior Health: Flowed illegal kickbacks directly to patients to secure their attendance at PSR sessions.

F. STATE-SPECIFIC POLICY ANALYSIS
1. Regulatory Non-Compliance
Florida was found non-compliant with 42 CFR § 455.21(c)(3)(iv) due to the lack of clear fraud referral procedures in its MFCU MOU. This specific federal regulation mandates that states must have established procedures for MCOs to refer potential fraud.
2. Privatization Aggression
The state's policy of "aggressive privatization" (SMMC) creates an environment where oversight is delegated to the very entities (MCOs) incentivized to minimize administrative "friction," potentially suppressing fraud reporting to avoid regulatory scrutiny.

G. HOT-TOPIC DEEP DIVES
1. DEEP DIVE: The "Ghost Trip" Epidemic (NEMT Fraud)
    • Context: Florida mirrors New York in the prevalence of NEMT fraud due to high subcontracting rates.
    • Mechanism: Providers bill for "deadhead miles"—driving empty vehicles and claiming a passenger is on board—or fabricate trips entirely.
    • Systemic Failure: Because MCOs use third-party brokers, the state AHCA cannot see the ride data in real-time, making verification nearly impossible.
2. DEEP DIVE: Pharmaceutical Kickbacks (Gilead Case)
    • Financial Impact: $3 million settlement.
    • Mechanism: Gilead paid providers via "awards" and "travel" to prescribe Biktarvy and Genvoya.
    • Significance: This highlights that fraud is not just a "small provider" issue but involves major pharmaceutical corporations exploiting the SMMC formulary systems.
3. DEEP DIVE: Physician-Owned MCO Conflicts
    • Risk: When the insurer and the provider are financially linked, the check-and-balance system evaporates.
    • Vulnerability: CMS identified that Florida lacks "stronger safeguards" against conflicts of interest in these arrangements. A physician owner may deny necessary care to boost the MCO's profit, or conversely, approve unnecessary care if the reimbursement structure favors their clinic.

H. CASE MAPPING
1. Case: Newtech Medical Supply
    • Key Actor: Eduardo Tieles Ruiz (Owner).
    • Entity: Newtech Medical Supply.
    • Scheme: $2.9M billing for Durable Medical Equipment (DME) never provided.
    • Oversight Failure: Failure of data analytics to flag high-volume billing for unverified deliveries.
    • Status: Part of $14.6B DOJ Takedown (2025).
2. Case: Gilead Sciences
    • Key Actor: Gilead Sciences (Pharma Manufacturer).
    • Mechanism: Kickbacks (Meals, Travel, Awards).
    • Target: Providers prescribing HIV drugs (Biktarvy, Genvoya).
    • Financial Flow: Corporate funds $\to$ Provider Perks $\to$ False Medicaid Claims.
    • Outcome: $3M Settlement.
3. Case: Physician Partners of America (PPA)
    • Key Actor: PPA (Tampa-based).
    • Scheme: Unnecessary testing + False SBA Loan applications.
    • Trigger: Whistleblower allegations.
    • Outcome: $24.5M Settlement.

K. FINAL STATE SUMMARY: FLORIDA
1. Key Fraud Mechanisms
Florida's Medicaid fraud landscape is dominated by phantom billing (NEMT and DME), pharmaceutical kickbacks, and psychosocial rehabilitation schemes. The high privatization rate has created opaque layers where subcontractors operate with limited direct state scrutiny.
2. Key Actors
    • Perpetrators: DME suppliers (Newtech), Pharma giants (Gilead), and specialized clinics (Florida Behavior Health).
    • Enablers: 16 MCOs with weak fraud referral protocols; Physician-owned insurers with conflicts of interest.
3. Execution & Concealment
Fraudsters exploit the data lag between MCOs and the state. By the time AHCA audits an MCO, the subcontractor (e.g., an NEMT provider) may have already billed millions in "ghost trips" and dissolved the shell company.
4. Oversight Failures
The primary failure is regulatory inertia. The MFCU agreement is 5 years out of date, and MCOs are not strictly compelled to refer fraud, violating CMS $\S 455.21$.
5. Structural Recommendations
    • Immediate Update of MFCU MOU: Mandate direct fraud referrals from MCOs to MFCU.
    • Real-Time NEMT Monitoring: Bypass brokers to require GPS verification for all transportation claims.
    • Conflict of Interest Firewalls: Ban or strictly regulate profit-sharing in Physician-Owned MCOs.

L. CROSS-STATE COMPARISON
1. Shared Patterns (Florida vs. National Trends)
    • NEMT Vulnerability: Florida shares the "ghost trip" epidemic with New York (as noted in source 74). Both states suffer from fragmented oversight due to the heavy use of transportation brokers.
    • Political Influence: The strong link between insurer donations and political favor (Humana/Centene) is a national trend, but "most visible" in Florida due to the sheer volume of donations relative to other states.
2. Unique State Weaknesses
    • MOU Stagnation: Unlike states with active annual reviews, Florida's 5-year gap in updating its MFCU agreement stands out as a significant administrative failure.
    • Physician-Owned MCOs: The specific citation of "Physician-Owned MCOs" as a major blind spot appears unique to Florida's market structure in this dataset.
3. Systemic Synthesis
Florida represents the "Privatization Paradox": While delegating care to MCOs was intended to increase efficiency, it has decentralized fraud detection, creating silos where fraud festers undetected by the central state authority. The lack of "return on investment" tracking for service verification indicates a system prioritized for payment velocity rather than payment integrity.
